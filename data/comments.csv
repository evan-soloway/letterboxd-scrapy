2016-09-10,https://boxd.it/8HDbv,"Decided to watch the movie after reading this review, impressed you loved it so much, l thought it was a cute little love story, well-done for what it was. Not quite the acclaim you gave it. I'm more curious as to why ion loved it so much"
2016-09-13,https://boxd.it/Ez0P,"I love Letterboxd, and I find myself agreeing and if not appreciating the average number ratings of films; after all, the folks on this site are often very sharp and have fascinating opinions. This is why the 3.9 rating for E.T. was so shocking to me. I didn't realize so many people disliked this film simply due to it's sentimentality, even in spite of it's clear and powerful influence on modern cinema and pop culture."

2016-09-19,https://boxd.it/9eyob,"Also saw in 70mm of course, and I'll be damned if it's not impressive; one of the most beautiful films ever made, scratch that, THE most beautiful film ever made"
2016-09-19,https://boxd.it/6PHRX,The above statement is about 137.309% correct
2016-09-23,https://boxd.it/bnn4P,"This is perhaps too harsh a review, but I must admit, I'm in agreeance on almost everything you say, particularly about the movie's lack of a <i>point; </i>keyword here is <i>point. </i>I liked the film initially, but the more I think about it, the colder I realize it left me"

2016-09-23,https://boxd.it/9OUV,"Dear Egg MacGuffin,

I love your reviews, I enjoy reading them and evaluating your opinion, even (and especially) when I don't agree. I respect all opinions from all places, however I feel the need to address your review of this film at a slight length in order to comment on a larger error I see occurring in film criticism, particularly among younger  millennials. This prevalent issue I see is that people dismiss films simply because of what they see as ""plot holes."" Now, ""plot holes,"" are a phrase I hear repeated over and over again and I can't take it any longer. For god's sake, I'm sure if someone tried hard enough, they could find plot holes in Romeo and Juliet, but that's not what matters in film or general storytelling, what truly speaks volumes is the emotion, the spectacle, the characters, that feeling you get when you watch a great film, when plot, characters, and visuals have converged in such a sweet spot that to deny yourself of such catharsis would be a personal disservice. Now if you're a person who can't help but be sunk by the ""plot hole"" conundrum, then I don't know what to say, acknowledging your own personal dissatisfaction with The Dark Knight is a fine thing, but claiming it as a ""poor film"" seems monumentally unfair. Once again, I respect your opinion, and I do not wish to change it, I just wish to comment on this unhealthy trend of discarding the meat of what makes film great and substituting it for nitpicking and ""plot holes"" which could easily be used to sink literally any and all great works of art ever created. So next time you go to the louvre, and take a gaze at the magnificent Mona Lisa, rather than putting your face so close to the painting so as to magnify the aging textures and color, take a step back,  look upon the artwork as a whole, and hopefully you can enjoy it a little more."
2016-09-23,https://boxd.it/9OUV,"Using Akira Kurosawa's wise words on screenwriting to attack this film seems a bit moot. I imagine Kurosawa's words on screenwriting would relate more so to poor plot structure and characters, both of which were at least thought up reasonably well for TDK, your complaints all claim to be ""problems"" with the plot rather than actually calling the plot and characters itself poor. Also, I'm sorry, but I think nitpicking is just plain wrong, there's more to creating a great work of art than ""how did he place all those bombs?"" Or ""how is it that the authorities can't destroy that truck?"" The point is not how, the point is why. Within the context of his character, why did the joker plant those bombs? What are the implications of his plot to turn Harvey Dent into a criminal? What does that mean for the nature of morality? What does it take for a decent human being to become a
monster? Is there truly any such thing as a ""good man"" to begin with? These are the questions I'm asking, clearly you have a different mindset."
2016-09-23,https://boxd.it/9OUV,"In The Godfather, what was the whole point of Tom flying across the country just so he could talk for 10 minutes with some studio head before he left the poor guy in bed with a decapitated bloody stallion? If the Corleone family was so efficient with money, why would they prioritize this issue above others? So what, Johnny Fontane is Vito's godson, and he wants a part in a Hollywood film, is that really worth all of the family's troubles. Also, what's with the whole decapitated horse in bed thing, why didn't Tom just put a gun to the studio head's face and tell him ""give Johnny the damn part or I'll blow your brains out."" What's with all the theatrics, what is this, a movie? 

I mean, I suppose the point of that subplot might've been to establish"
2016-09-23,https://boxd.it/9OUV,"that Vito Corleone put a heavy emphasis on family, cause, that was his character. He wasn't a flawless machine who made completely logical decisions which would've resulted in no plot holes, he was actually a fascinating character. Also I suppose the whole descapitated horse in bed thing was to show the brutality yet also the indifference with which the Corleone family operated; also it's one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema, but that doesn't matter. Tom shouldn't have wasted his time on a task so ridiculous, he should've been more direct and less poetic, because that's what makes interesting films. The best movies are the ones which make total logical sense, regardless of the intrigue or visual interest they may lack. It's all about the logic; if a film can't withstand the most insignificant of ""plot holes"" then it's terrible and sucks. So instead of sitting down to think about the complex moral quandries and poetic story-telling which The Godfather presents, I'm just going to complain that it makes no sense. Why? Because why not."
2016-09-24,https://boxd.it/9OUV,"Thanks for responding to my comment, also I kinda want to apologize for some of the mocking I did in a few of my latter comments, I'm not sure if you care, but I just feel a little bad, i was ranting basically, it was inappropriate"
2016-09-26,https://boxd.it/aTod9,"Dirk, I'm not sure where you live, but you should strategically visit either Los Angeles or Seattle whenever they're showing 2001 on one of their Cinerama screens; trust me, it's a life-changing experience"
2016-09-26,https://boxd.it/bm517,"It's interesting how you gave the movie 5 stars but said it wasn't really your cup of tea. I think that's really interesting, you should tell me more about that in the comments for my review/open forum I just started on this very topic"
2016-09-26,https://boxd.it/bm5vV,Elaborate on your personal opinion for this film in my review/open forum I just made on this movie
2016-09-26,https://boxd.it/bm4X5,"I'm curious on whether or not you see the movie as a personal favorite, or an objective work of art which you don't truly identify with. Please elaborate in the comments for my new review/open forum I made on this subject. I'm genuinely curious about your opinion in more explicit terms"
2016-09-27,https://boxd.it/bqo7B,"@Gin4646 No, I don't. That's precisely why I find this phenomenon for 2001 to be unique and fascinating. It's my FAVORITE film, while many others claim BEST film, and I want to know where the line is between personally loving something, and appreciating something. Also, if you APPRECIATE but don't really like 2001, but still gave it 5 stars, I'm curious how the film really affected those people PERSONALLY. For me personally, I find that when I give movies a Letterboxd rating, it is my SUBJECTIVE opinion, not objective. Therefore, If I appreciated 2001, but didn't personally love it, I wouldn't rate it 5 stars."
2016-09-27,https://boxd.it/bqUnL,"Oh man, we're bein' pretty hard on Spielberg here"
2016-09-27,https://boxd.it/bqUnL,"Well, he's certainly one of the most influential, important, and yeah, probably talented directors to ever have lived. I must say actually, I think I like him a lot more than you probably do. He's no Kubrick, no Eisenstein, but still pretty damn good, and important."
2016-09-29,https://boxd.it/bqo7B,@Stafford Vaughn My thoughts completely
2016-10-02,https://boxd.it/buZTF,"Completely agree, this is cinema being utilized to it's fullest and most beautiful abilities; easily one of my favorite films"
2016-10-02,https://boxd.it/apWft,"I hope this films stays as fresh to me when I'm 40 as it does to me now, because it seems that this movie tends to be more affecting for ""younger"" viewers than for older (read Roger Ebert's before and after reviews for a unique perspective)."
2016-10-12,https://boxd.it/ORrU,"OH MY GOD! You're right, I need   The Player somewhere in here"
2016-10-12,https://boxd.it/bDH5Z,Far too many times
2016-10-17,https://boxd.it/bezcD,This is one of the few blockbusters I feel can be called a legitimate artistic triumph; absolutely everything about it works. One of my favorites!
2016-10-19,https://boxd.it/bJdRL,"I'm going to be honest, I went to see ""Solaris"" at a BFI theatre in London, and even in such an optimal setting, I fell asleep during the film, which I've literally NEVER HAD HAPPEN except for this one time. I liked the movie objectively, but I couldn't really feel the pure cinematic experience emerging for me. What am I missing from Tarkovsky?"
2016-10-20,https://boxd.it/bKLpj,"Nope, I actually was just about to go to bed when I suddenly saw it playing on Retroplex. I was reminded of My fondness for it, so I sat tight for a re-watch. As for Lincoln Square, I'm saving my money for when they show The Shining"
2016-10-20,https://boxd.it/bKLpj,Correction: *INCREDIBLE fondness for it
2016-10-24,https://boxd.it/8bckB,This movie accompanied by this review basically summarizes everything wrong with the worst of Hollywood
2016-10-28,https://boxd.it/bQUTT,"Stafford, you're great. Your love of filmmakers such as Kieślowski and Polanski is inspiring, and you're awesome. So I'm REALLY curious what you didn't like about The Shining, beside the fact that the film does, of course, overlook many of the more realistic human elements in favor of a confusing, seemingly nonsensical conflict between the supernatural and the psychological"
2016-10-28,https://boxd.it/bQUTT,"In my opinion, Kubrick's genius in this film comes into play through the distinct LACK of realistic human behavior. None of the characters are relatable, or realistic, while the hotel seems to leer into every scene with a  frightening  silence. The audience is therefore <i>alienated </i>in a distinctly Kubrickian way."
2016-10-28,https://boxd.it/bQUTT,"<a href=""http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-shining-1980"">http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-shining-1980</a>
Read Roger Ebert's ""Great Movies"" review of the film if you want an in-depth analysis and explanation as to why The Shining is probably the greatest horror film ever made."
2016-10-28,https://boxd.it/bQUTT,"Also, the scene between Jack and Mr. Gradey in the red bathroom is literally my personal favorite movie scene in any film ever"
2016-10-29,https://boxd.it/bQUTT,"@Stafford Vaughan yeah, that makes sense. Kubrick's deliberate coldness (I swear no pun intended) towards his characters can be off-putting for many; this disregard and disrespect also pretty evident in his deliberately mean-spirited treatment of actors such as Shelley Duvall. I'd say Kubrick was, in some ways, more of a philosopher than a filmmaker, so in that case, his intellectual pessimism is not too disimilar from his peers (Freud, Socrates, etc). I suppose I'm just a bit of a pessimist myself."
2016-11-06,https://boxd.it/bYsq1,"Thank you very much Isaak. Oh, and yes, I have seen The Iron Giant; that film is excellent as well, though in my opinion at least, not <i>quite </i>as brilliant as WALL-E can be at its best moments, but then again, that's because WALL-E is honestly just too damn good, TIG still has some <i>really</i> interesting ideas about 50s paranoia and the Cold War."
2016-11-07,https://boxd.it/qUR3,"I have an irrational love for this movie, I think it's one of the most inventive, creative, innovative, and exciting Hollywood blockbusters ever made. I love the world it creates, I love the visuals, the music, the editing, etc. However, I must say that your points are spot on, nearly all of them. So I suppose I'm only commenting here not to start an argument but simply to ask myself and others an important question; what do you value when you watch a movie? What do you look for? Because, for me, my favorite films are those in which the director's attitude is basically this; he pulls up a chair directly in front of you, leans in very closely and says ""hey, I'm gonna show you something you've never seen before."" And for me, that's Christopher Nolan in a nutshell."
2016-11-07,https://boxd.it/qUR3,"I suppose you're right, it's just that, for me personally, I like to give Nolan credit and admiration because, even if you don't like his style of direction or screenwriting, I think one must admit that he's at least <i>trying </i>to do something unique and different, which I feel is much more than you can say for most modern blockbuster filmmakers"
2016-11-12,https://boxd.it/c3i4f,"Thanks Elliot, I'm glad you didn't find my own review as pretentious as I did! But then again, I think
this movie deserves all the praise it can get"
2016-11-12,https://boxd.it/c3i4f,"It's a celebration of intelligence and thought in a time when irrational and dangerous decisions are made on a whim, often out of desperation"
2016-11-12,https://boxd.it/c3i4f,Everyone should see this friggin' movie
2016-11-16,https://boxd.it/c70op,"Well, that's the Irony of it, his values kinda clash with what's tropically considered ""great cinema,"" so this is why I find it interesting when I put a <i>Scarface </i>person and a <i>Godfather</i> person together to argue which is better"
2016-11-16,https://boxd.it/c70op,"Unfortunately, most of the De Palma films I've seen are his ""bad"" ones; <i>Mission Impossible</i>, <i>Black Dahlia</i>, <i>Mission to Mars</i>. The ""great"" De Palma films I've seen are <i>Carrie</i>, <i>Carlito's Way</i>, and now <i>Scarface, </i>although even those movies seem to be constantly criticized by film circles."
2016-11-16,https://boxd.it/c70op,"I think Brian De Palma is an interesting filmmaker because his scope is as ambitious as those of his more acclaimed compatriots, yet his distinct style is often what separates him from not only other, lesser directors, but his fellow ""Film Brats"" as well. He lacks the elegance of Coppola, or the street-smart invention of Scorcese, and thus, even in spite of his exciting and unique visual stylings, for some reason it seems none of his movies will ever be as widely respected by the film world as a whole. The closest film he has to that level of ""Widely-Renowned Masterpiece"" would perhaps be 
<i>Blow Out.</i>"
2016-11-17,https://boxd.it/c3UNn,"I thought the animation was pretty good back in 2002, but, eh"
2016-12-06,https://boxd.it/cpwl9,"Thanks for your comment Dr. Dick! I'm glad you said what I honestly had trouble putting simply into words; that <i>Mulholland Drive </i>is somehow all of Lynch's films in one, and yet at the same time completely original and cinematically hypnotic, even more-so than <i>Eraserhead </i>I would say"
2016-12-08,https://boxd.it/cpwl9,"Agreed completely, the only difference is that... Well.... I do love Eraserhead though, however I DEFINITELY understand where people are coming from when they say they don't feel the movie, it is NOT for everyone."
2016-12-23,https://boxd.it/cG1l7,"@Dr. Dick. I can't lie that FWWM is certainly an excellently made work of art, and I most definitely understand why you and many others love it for its hypnotic qualities. As to why it elicited such a strongly negative, emotional reaction from me is difficult to say, it is perhaps, the Lynch film which emotionally impacted me the most besides <i>Mulholland Drive </i>and<i> Eraserhead. </i>However, where I absolutely laid both <i>Mulholland Drive </i>and <i>Eraserhead</i> as two of the greatest motion pictures ever made, for some reason there's a small sub-group of Lynch films which really bother me for almost the same reasons I love his best films. It just seems like there's this balance which I personally feel surrealist films, and most definitely Lynch films, must startle in order to achieve greatness, and if that effort is faltered just a little, the entire film falls from its wire and plummets toward the earth, faster and faster, until it bursts into flames. Unfortunately for me, that's FWWM in a nutshell."
2016-12-23,https://boxd.it/cG1l7,<i>*laid </i>should be <i>laud</i>
2016-12-23,https://boxd.it/cG1l7,*<i>Startle </i>should be <i>Strattle </i>
2016-12-23,https://boxd.it/cG1l7,"@Dr. Dick.
In Complete Agreeance"
2017-01-07,https://boxd.it/7ahpZ,"It's hard to say this in a way which won't sound elitist, but part of the reason I absolutely adore this movie is <b>because</b> it's so dividing. For me, David Lynch's films are a definite ""love-it or hate-it"" ordeal, but Eraserhead has got to be my personal favorite; I think it's a masterpiece; although then again, I kinda hate <i>Wild at Heart</i> and <i>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me </i>while others love them so, he's just one of those filmmakers whose work is enjoyably dividing."
2017-01-13,https://boxd.it/d96mn,"Yes, I truly do understand yours and others' profound love for Annie Hall now; for some reason now more than ever"
2017-01-13,https://boxd.it/V9VA,"Wait, why's <i>Annie Hall </i>on here?"
2017-02-08,https://boxd.it/dJ9aV,"@IsaakvonSeggern goddamn, thank you for your layered response. It's fascinating for me to observe the vast array of opinions and take-aways from this movie; it probably is one of the most baffling films I've ever seen in my life (in a very good way), and so I take reverie in understanding the plight of others as they relate to <i>Silence</i>. For now, all I know is that I can't judge it quite yet, I'll most definitely have to see it again. Also, your comment about people wanting the film to lean to one side or the other of it's subject matter, is one of the most penetrative statements which can be made on it's currently very obvious lack of popularity among the film community, so thank you for that poignant thought."
2017-08-26,https://boxd.it/jzOFz,Saw that you gave Good Time 5 stars; damn. I'll see it as soon as I'm finished with Lawrence of Arabia in 70mm.
2017-09-06,https://boxd.it/jSKzv,"thanks for the info, didn't realize that was the case. Still kinda a shame this can't be catalogued though. What a pity; it's one of my new favorites"
2017-11-13,https://boxd.it/cqoJz,"in retrospect, this review is SOOO pretentious... I can't even believe it"
2017-11-16,https://boxd.it/7HPKj,"You make this 7-minute cartoon feel as though it were a towering epic; it’s amazing how huge the short feels when viewed through the lens of your writing. Like seriously, thank you for this... it’s beyond effable satisfaction when the written word manages to encapsulate so precisely the significance of a work."
2017-11-28,https://boxd.it/17qT6,"I'm not sure if this has been a particularly strong year, I'm only sure that I haven't seen many films this year which I could call bad, and that's more due to my prioritization of which films I want to see when I'm busy and have limited time to see them.

As for Wind River, that is one of the five films this year which I would consider ""bad."" I just thought that it felt incredibly recycled from similar crime thrillers of the past and I disagreed strongly with it's moderate pro-libertarian leanings... but hey, let's not get political here. I just didn't like it very much."
2017-11-28,https://boxd.it/17qT6,"Also, I'll clarify: what I specifically disagreed with in Wind River was the fact that (SPOILERS) the Jeremy Renner character's final act of vigilante justice was portrayed as heroic; I find the implications of that assertion kind of frightening. But that is just me and my specific opinion, and I do acknowledge that the film was pleasantly atmospheric and well-made in many respects. I just didn't like the pathos behind it."
2017-12-23,https://boxd.it/eC8q9,"Not enough Letterboxd reviews manage to be as singularly perceptive as your brief piece here; thank you for this, it's damn good."
2018-02-24,https://boxd.it/p4WJh,"I'll give a little semantics lesson: I used the word ""sterile"" in an effort to communicate the movie's tone, which I felt was coolly bereft of human interest. My use of the word ""conceit"" is also just to mean ""an inventive or fanciful notion."" (sigh), this is starting to make me think I should write a full review."
2018-02-24,https://boxd.it/p4WJh,Also for the record I LOVE <i>Phase IV<i>
2018-04-12,https://boxd.it/qTdLj,"That's the irony of Netflix; great movies, great ORIGINAL movies, yet no audiences to see them (or at least, not ones in the same room)"
2018-04-30,https://boxd.it/roMkz,I concur
2018-05-19,https://boxd.it/saet9,yeah and that stint of nervous laughter when it cut to credits was cathartic. This maybe my favorite of the year.
2018-05-21,https://boxd.it/aXEtl,this review was facetious
2018-05-29,https://boxd.it/suraz,"yeah don't worry the 4K restoration is unbelievable, and will probably look as such on television as well. You won't be disappointed"
2018-07-14,https://boxd.it/u6xOv,"thanks Jacob, and i also agree that coraline transcends the “kids movie” stigma; i think its more *about* childhood than it is pandering to it."
2018-08-26,https://boxd.it/vNCAD,Cinerama is seattle’s cinematic lifeblood
2018-12-01,https://boxd.it/zpSLF,"Note: I'm aware the MPAA's furor was generated by IFC's <b>distribution<b> of the Unrated cut, not its content. My argument early in this review however is that the Director's Cuts ""Unrated"" status is inexplicable to begins with; were the film more commercially viable but just as violent, it would've likely passed for an R, and IFC wouldn't have had to dance about with their ""One-Night Only"" exhibition at all."
2018-12-18,https://boxd.it/8HjM,"<i>Decalogue<i> and <i>Twin Peaks: The Return<i> should definitely be on here; in spite of their length and apparent ""TV"" format they're both masterpieces of cinema. It's time to redefine our definition of ""Movie""!"
2018-12-20,https://boxd.it/AdkjH,"I agree that the self-consciously *restrained* style of Roma butts heads with its narrative and functionally fails because of how knowingly constructed its “naturalism” is. However, my interpretation of the style’s relationship with its narrative is that it feels a bit like... odd analogy upcoming: a snowglobe. Its deliberate construction bars scenes like the hospital tragedy and beach/drowning incident from effectively elliciting emotion in their own right because of how intentional and artificial their construction is, however the <b>cumulative</b> impression I gather is one of a weird quasi-melancholic aching for the past which I dont think is possible without Cuaron’s deliberately constructed simulacra of naturalism. Roma’s individual scenes don’t ellicit emotion, but I think the movie itself in its totality ellicits and aura of nostalgic woe. So i agree it fails as a neorealist proxy, BUT as a manifestation of <i>Synecdoche, New York’s </i>suffoxating<i> </i>“city in a warehouse” existential conceit, I think it succeeds (possibly inadvertantly but nevertheless)."
2018-12-20,https://boxd.it/AdkjH,Also by the by I saw this in a BIG theatre with Dolby Atmos so i may be biased in that regard

2021-10-22,https://boxd.it/2dLsY1,Gus van sant deserves a lotta credit too he's an underrated director
2021-10-24,https://boxd.it/2ecbsB,"Good review, though i liked it a little more than you. I think that part 2 will address a lot of the issues your mentioned. The problem with part 1 is that its all setup. This all seems like a rehash of what happened when Fellowship of the Rings came out and people werent totally in yet."
2021-11-15,https://boxd.it/2hRhiB,let's have a deep conversation bout this at some point. Lots to talk about. Not 100% sold on this as a masterpiece yet.

2022-01-14,https://boxd.it/2tev5L,this was the first pta movie i saw back in '12 it literally took me 7 years from when i first saw it to actually like it
2022-01-14,https://boxd.it/2tev5L,also keep in mind this was joaquin's first movie in like 4 years cause he was just 2 years before doing this while fake rao career thing and everyone thought he was legit crazy (including me). I legit thought joaquin had mental problems when i saw this movie. After i saw Her the mext year i actually appreciated his performance in this a lot more def his beat qork imo

2022-03-04,https://boxd.it/2Da1HH,"2022: 4.4
2032: 3.4"
2022-03-05,https://boxd.it/2Da1HH,Admittedly i've not seen it yet but im not expecting much. I wasnt planning on seeing it but with this sudden and unexpected flood of acclaim i think i'll have to check it out.
2022-03-06,https://boxd.it/2Da1HH,"just watched; i think it did feel a bit like two movies. SPOILERS: I thought the riddler and falcone plot seemed a little disconnected. I also did think the movie was too long; the stuff with annika didn't seem essential, we didn't need her whole backstory for falcone to be ratted out at the end. probably could've been cut. I DID like the whole riddler-as-incel angle, AND I liked the idea of corporate corruption being the underlying thread, but the two going together was a little uneasy. if they'd ended the movie with that confrontation at Arkham I would've def liked it more. The dark knight is a much better movie in my book. matt reeves did a great job with this but similar to his planet of the apes films i felt like this was a bit of a hodgepodge of influences, and it owes a debt more to Joker than to chris nolan."
2022-03-06,https://boxd.it/2Da1HH,i don't think the movie could've been made as dark as it is unless joker was a gigantic hit
2022-03-07,https://boxd.it/2DBbGX,damn son y'all gotta watch more Ozu

2022-04-07,https://boxd.it/2IYeib,not gonna lie this movie kinda made me feel old
2022-04-07,https://boxd.it/2GsaBB,okay low key didn't this remind you of evangelion? japan is always 20 years ahead somehow
2022-04-07,https://boxd.it/2JsjU5,tbh the last 30 minutes kinda botched the movie i thought the climax didnt quite work and it stretched on and on and the resolution seemed a little incomplete but i really need to see it again to form an opinion. The movie is just so much to process and its definitely a movie that works better while you're watching it than thinking afterwards. nevertheless i still legit think this is going to inspire a new generation of filmmakers like pulp fiction did and we're gonna see a lot of movies next couple years trying to do something like this and failing.
2022-04-07,https://boxd.it/2JsjU5,thats the biggest compliment i could possibly pay a movie
2022-04-07,https://boxd.it/2JsjU5,i just figured it out. I think the movie had to decide between making the father or the daughter the emotional focal point. during the scene where evelyn was confronting her husband in all the verses i was moved but then when it got to the daughter i was exhausted. there was a have your cake and eat it too feeling i think they should cut one of those down because it feels like the movie has two emotional climaxes one after the other
