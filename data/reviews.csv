2016-08-13,2001: A Space Odyssey,1968,https://boxd.it/aPLh1,5,,"Just by virtue of the fact that I'm even attempting as I type to summarize or critique this film, it may already come across as condescending. Why? Because the one simple, undeniable fact is that ""2001"" stands for significantly more than any critic or historian could claim about it. So I find myself in this strange scenario; attempting to write about the film myself. In mounting this inevitably indifferent yet still meaningful task, I ask myself, ""how should I communicate my message?"" The message indeed, seems to be a simple one, the message indeed seems to be that ""2001"" is a transcendent work of art. You see, already it becomes a bit cliche, I find myself falling into the pitfalls of others. ""2001 is transcendent, 2001 is amazing,"" and so on. So I came to this conclusion, and the conclusion is that I could perhaps write the review in a way which represents the films ideas, and so I willfully considered writing this review entirely in morse code. I felt the need to write the review in a way which epitomizes the films very ideals of evolution and human change. ""Brilliant! It forces the reader to evolve their own sensibilities in order to read and understand my review, therefore i will myself be extending the films optimistic goals,"" as far as I was concerned. Then it hit me, like a spectacular apiphany which couldn't have even occurred to me until I took a step back and thought deeply. Even morse code couldn't possibly describe the film, nothing could; this film isn't a matter of words, but visuals, visuals that speak to us so much louder than any read calligraphy or type possibly could. It's about the balletic movement of the space stations, spinning their gears and practical structures in the same manner which a dancer spins their bodies, telling beautiful poems simply through the natural human perception of such gentle movement. And all in a sudden, the vastness of the universe is suddenly rendered true; true by the beauty of the orbit, the slow pace of the docking sequence. The Galaxy, the empty space, is suddenly felt, as if a previously transparent purse, has just opened its top, redefining the view one has of something perceived to be there, and yet couldn't possibly understand. This is just one example however, and the rest is equal in its beauty, and similar in its portrayal of the vast unknown universe. No matter what one can say about 2001, the truth is that by the end of the film, the audiences perception of the universe will be just a little bit larger.

2016-08-19,A Clockwork Orange,1971,https://boxd.it/aU85l,5,,"Well, what a film this is indeed. It's rare when a film truly jumps out of the screen it inhabits, elevating itself to a place of importance in the mind of it's viewer which is wholly undeniable. The film is violent, difficult, perhaps even wretched, and yet you keep watching. There's something there that's difficult to describe, but regardless of your moral views, it is there. ""A Clockwork Orange"" runs backwards and contradictory to itself, ultimately representing the title itself. 

After I finished watching the film for the first time, I was stunned, the film contains one of those endings in which, as the final frame closes, the entire weight of the film is undeniably felt. Then I had a revelation. I thought, ""what could this film have looked like being directed by anyone else besides Stanley Kubrick?"" It occurred to me, a typically dramatic director would read the script and immediately think, 

""hmm, well, this is the story of a vile, hateful psychopath who is denied his own justifiable punishment by society's political and moral dillusions."" Then they'd move on, ""how do we show our main character? Well, he's a violent psychopath, the audience couldn't possibly identify, the camera remains distant, his character is inscrutable; we don't so much follow him as much as we observe him. We see how Alex ruins the world around him, how all are innocent victims, and how he should be punished. What else could the film be?"" 
Then the director figures out what the tone should be, ""Well, dark, disturbing of course. Lots of darkness, lots of shadows, dark techno music, we see the inherent darkness of the world this story inhabits, the anarchy, the destruction."" So there you go, this film would be released, be praised by critics as the masterful story of a disturbed teen and the moral questions concerning his actions and lack of punishment. It would also probably win best picture and be called ""a modern classic"". The film would be forgotten due to its ultimately dull look and pace, lack of genuine style, and surface-level analysis. 

But, that didn't happen, Kubrick made it. The film was controversial and dangerous, and despite being generally upbeat and even humorous at times, is even darker than this alternate version I've proposed. Kubrick is smarter, more biting, more humorous, he sees how obviously the story could potentially be presented, and subverts it. The film doesn't observe Alex, it MAKES US ALEX. We see his victims as emotionless cutouts, older men and women whom we see at a distance. 

Just imagine, an alternate version of the infamous ""Singin' in the Rain"" rape scene, with an almost theatrical wide shot replaced with intensified close-ups of the victims, Alex leering disgustingly into their personal spaces; his slime completely evident, as a dark drone plays beneath the horror. But no, it's Singin' in the Rain, emotionless, dead, and all the more disturbing and self-reflective for it. That's the brilliance of Kubrick.",,2016-07-29
2016-08-20,Inception,2010,https://boxd.it/aUpgZ,5,,"A film as magical and imaginative as this comes around only once every so often, and therefore must be treasured and appreciated at the very least. Inception is without a doubt one of the best recent examples of REAL movie magic. Everything works as intended, and it works to marvelous, spectacular effect. The characters are drawn in precisely the way they must be, they're in the film to serve one purpose, and their purposes are utilitized. Some may argue that Inception lacks well written characters, and to this I argue; Inception really isn't about its characters. The characters are there, they are human, they are recognizable, but the fact is that this film is too busy for anymore characterization. This film's focus is the dream, the landscape of the dream, the psychology, the visuals, the complex heist set-up, and it's all so beautiful. This is a film about the human mind not as a practical object, but as a wonderous and endlessly inventive playground. And yet, despite all the seeming confusion, it is undeniably cohesive, exciting, and truly, truly magical, Inception is one of the most memorable Hollywood film experiences of the 21st century so far.",,2010-07-16
2016-08-20,Taxi Driver,1976,https://boxd.it/aUps7,5,,"The greatest example of the non-film, the non-spectacle, a film that deals itself purely in character and psychology rather than excitement or beauty. This is a dirty film, a rugged film, a film that asks a lot of you, the least of which is to simply endure it. And yet, once the film has ended, it's hard to forget the moral quandary that's laid on the watcher. Taxi Driver is a film where there are no clear moral or ethical answers, and while in some movies that could become heresy, in Taxi Driver its a miracle. This is a film that will make you rethink the nature of objectivity and subjectivity itself. What a memorable, odd, terrific; absolutely terrific film this is.",,2013-03-24
2016-08-20,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,2004,https://boxd.it/aUIc3,5,,"The most visually brilliant and emotionally resonant representation of memories, dreams, and the theoretical complexity of the human mind. Michel Gondry's direction perfectly juxtaposes the naturalistic with the surreal in a subtle and effecting way. Charlie Kaufman's script is the real star though, coming across brilliantly in its complete exploration of the world and ideas it presents.",,2011-02-19
2016-08-20,Metropolis,1927,https://boxd.it/aUIKf,5,,"Metropolis is perhaps the greatest achievement in Epic filmmaking during the silent era, standing beside The Birth of a Nation (minus the racism of course) and Intolerance in their perfection of what would become the sprawling blockbusters we know today. What sets Metropolis apart however, is its scope and subject matter. The film is simply vast, with almost every scene bombarding the viewer with new, exciting, and beautiful productions to behold. For a film nearing 100 years old, the special effects are shockingly stylized and effective, perhaps not quite as convincing as those of today, but still appealing in their own strange way; the film makes it work. The story is constructed as a wonderous fable, full of large-scale societal/political issues, characters making huge decisions, and gigantic sets and spectacular effects used to bring them to life. Metropolis is transporting, even transcendent, it was Cinema's first leap into creating a world of fiction, one presented completely through visuals.",,2011-03-27

Greta Gerwig is amusingly beguiling as the title character in a movie with laughs occurring seemingly from everyday conversation, and dialogue so genuine and fraught with witty characteristics that the film deserves props simply for such a thing being done successfully.

Unfortunately, Warner Bros. got cold feet, and proceeded to re-edit the movie in a plea for fan satisfaction. While their attempts failed, I must at least clarify my respect for Warner Bros. in their attempts at doing something quite unique from the MCU, and for the most part, sticking to their directors' vision (Christopher Nolan anybody?). But beside that, Suicide Squad is 2 movies; the absolutely incoherent mess that is the first hour, and the much more streamlined and even enjoyable second half. So what does this uneven mess with a lot of good and a lot of bad get? A 3 out of 5. I liked it, and yet I couldn't.",,2016-08-22

2016-08-23,Under the Skin,2013,https://boxd.it/aXKtr,3,,"I really, really, really, really, really hate to say it, but this film just might be the very definition of ""over-rated,"" despite my general distaste for such words, particularly the liberal use of the word ""pretentious,"" one of the most dangerous words in film criticism. Under the Skin is quite a film; meandering, aimless, uninvolving, and yet there are images which still resonate, undeniably so. Despite this, I still find it difficult to like this film. I went in expecting a great film, wanting a great film, and what I got was a mix of classic Italian neorealism alongside bizarre visuals and ambiguous sci-fi concepts that in the end, didn't seem to mean much. Once the film ended, I felt underwhelmed, yet immediately felt compelled to read-up some theories on the internet pertaining as to what it all meant. Well I read a few, and now I have the firm belief that the film is in fact about the very deep concept of, gasp, people being good on the inside, but bad on the outside (hence the title). Well, that's certainly an original concept, I've never ever heard that concept explored on the Disney Channel, kids movies, after school specials, PSAs, Anti-Bullying documentaries, PBS specials, Nicktoons cartoons . . .",,2014-10-24

2016-08-25,Hell or High Water,2016,https://boxd.it/aZ5lF,3.5,,"A refreshingly subdued, classic-style and yet still very modern western. A-list performance from Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges give heft. The film is simple, straight-forward, but told with enough elegance to come across in a sometimes suspenseful, involving way. If there was one problem, it could perhaps be that the film is a bit too quietly paced; every scene starts and ends with a light push, there is never really any great sense of urgency throughout the entire film. However, this was probably intentional, and serves as only a minor bug in my personal opinion.",,2016-08-24
2016-08-25,Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,2015,https://boxd.it/aZ5OR,2,,"A hopelessly cloying dramedy that, irritatingly enough, thinks it's smarter than it really is. Me, and Earl, and the Dying Girl, is one of those movies that desperately wants to be a Wes Anderson film, yet lacks the attention to detail, consistency, wit or humor. It also wants to use cancer as the primary thrust for a story-line, which is, in my opinion, never, ever, ever, ever a good idea. The characters are dull archetypes that don't actually live and breath; instead, they serve one purpose, to move the story along. This is particularly true of Earl, Greg's closest friend, who seems to be a disturbingly antiquated stereotype of ""the black friend who lives on a scary street but actually has more insight into people than his white friend,"" they're all forced, why would these people be friends? Also, to director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, I have this to say. I sat down, I watched your film, I gave your film my time and patience, and now, despite the fact that you are much, much more achieved than I, and that I was not forced to watch your film by anyone besides myself, I have this critique which you may or may not want to take into account (after all I have no intention of telling you what to do, you can make your own decisions of course, and I don't want to make this personal). However, you need to REALLY, REALLY decide what your film's look should be. Your camerawork is too showy, overbearing, ridiculous, the pans employed by your DP are artificial and stylized to a pointless detriment. Some scenes play out in extreme close-ups with a wide-angle lens; your costars have been diminished to nothing but mugging faces. In particular, a scene late in the film, following an admittedly expertly executed  argument between the titular ""me"" and ""dying girl,"" Greg gets into a fight in the school lunch-room, and the scene plays out in wide-angle close-ups, with an excess amount of mugging. Nothing dramatic or funny lies somewhere in the wreck of that scene. Anyway, the film is a mess, a hot mess, a mess where some things work, and some don't, but most things definitely, definitely, don't work. I like the movie parody's though, they don't take themselves too seriously, and just remain what they are without obnoxiously acknowledging themselves; I only wish the rest of the film could've been that.",,2016-08-24
2016-08-27,Don't Breathe,2016,https://boxd.it/b0MQt,3.5,,"A brilliantly executed and wonderfully simplistic horror film. The film has a tense atmosphere in which I genuinely felt that anything could happen; no character was safe. For what the film was, it succeeded with great excellence. Particular praise must be given to the directors' use of silence and pace, the film flows beautifully, and we're with the characters absolutely every step of the way. If there was one very minimal problem, it'd be that the ""twist"" in the film really isn't all that shocking, and if anything, feels a little unnecessary and shoe-horned in.",,2016-08-26
2016-08-29,Vampire's Kiss,1988,https://boxd.it/b2LBB,3.5,,"Despite problems with tone and focus, this cult film is surprisingly engaging in a remarkably strange way; buried deep in the film is an oddly thoughtful commentary on 80s wealth and excess.",,2016-08-29
2016-08-29,The Elephant Man,1980,https://boxd.it/b2Qbt,5,,"The line between sentimentality and the genuine sadness and misery that life offers can often times be razor thin. Few films showcase the latter in a greater fashion than The Elephant Man. David Lynch's first Hollywood outing is an atmospheric work of art, an exercise in tone and feeling similar in many ways to that of Lynch's sophemore effort Eraserhead. One crucial seperation however is the use of mood; the beautiful black and white photography of The Elephant Man takes on a greater purpose in the story, not only coming to represent the period and world properly, but in showing us the darkness with which John Merrick's world was full of. A world in which no person can properly look you in the eye without being overcome with such profound sorrow just at your very existence, and even then, it still remains better than being confronted with those who'll laugh and sneer. 

Lynch's masterwork concerns itself with two non-submergable pillars of importance; 1) Creating an engaging world made up of London's dim cobblestone streets, barely lit by candlelight and fog; mysterious yet opaque.  And 2) Showing the undoubtedly and undeniably depressing life of John Merrick, as well as the great positivity with which he projected onto it. The film is successful for these reasons, although what must be additionally mentioned is the films excellent pace, appropriately odd use of sound, and an absolutely astounding performance by John Hurt, who miraculously transcends his pounds of make-up, ultimately creating one of the most undoudebtly tragic characters in film history, and perhaps even reality. He did not choose to live this, and yet he must. ""My life is full,"" he says, ""my life is full because. . . I know I am loved."" We can only hope.",,2016-08-29
2016-08-31,Solaris,1972,https://boxd.it/b4sVB,4,,"Solaris is perhaps one of the most difficult films to review in any sense due to my personal difficulty getting through it. I saw the film at a BFI branded theatre in London near Leicester Square. It was, perhaps, the best way I could've seen the film, however, even in a movie theatre,
I must admit, my eyes were struggling. 

This was my first exposure to Andrei Tarkovsky, and it was perhaps not the best choice for introduction because I admittedly have, for the past 3 years since my first encounter with Solaris, feared putting on another one of his films. Solaris is an oddly mesmerizing film, it wields its power effortlessly through a slow pace and brilliant visuals. 

Yet, something was struggling to reach me, in addition to my struggle against sleep. During the film, I generally felt very distant to it, I had absolutely no emotional investment in the film. In fact, I find it a bit humorous in retrospect, reading about Tarkovsky's reasoning for making Solaris as a rebut to what he saw as a genuine ""coldness"" in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The funny thing is that 2001 of course remains my favorite film, ever, and I feel overwhelming emotion while watching that film, yet none during Solaris. I watched both films with the same mindset, in a similar venue, yet one stands out significantly over the other, and I genuinely wonder why that is. 

I suppose with this revelation I can only come to the conclusion that I view Solaris the way many view 2001, as this brilliant masterpiece which you can't help but acknowledge as such, yet cannot truly enjoy for yourself. Hey listen, I didn't say I didn't like the movie, it's just my eyelids spoke for themselves.",tarkovsky,2013-08-17
2016-09-03,I Am Number Four,2011,https://boxd.it/b6BEX,0.5,,"I feel genuinely sorry for every single person who worked on this film; and no, I'm not just referring to the Director or the Actors, I mean, EVERYONE.

It seems that there's an uncomfortably bizarre seperation between my opinion of this film and everyone else's. I love this movie, it's a spectacular sci-fi epic, but I dunno. It is what it is, and for some odd reason I just can't absolutely love it and embrace it as the masterpiece others see it as. Yes, in the context of the Star Wars series, ""Empire"" is without a doubt the best, it changed so very much, the world was made more palpable and expansive, not one moment is a rehash from the previous entry. Most of all, it introduced unseen depth into a world which had hitherto contained very little. There's one problem I see though, and for my taste, it's a major problem. The Star Wars world is simply not designed for complex characters and truly thought-provoking drama or sci-fi ideas. 

The reason the first Star Wars is a masterpiece is not nearly because of well-drawn characters, but because the very opposite. Star Wars' characters were archetypes, but they were used in the proper place, as emotional center-pieces in a spell-binding intergalactic fairy-tale. ""Empire"" very VERY honorably attempts to step up to the metaphorical plate, to swing out of the stadium and across the universe, but it hits an asteroid somewhere along the way. The asteroid comes in the form of an inherent paradox, and that paradox is that characters such as Luke, Han and Leia simply do not seem made for 4 or even 3-Dimensions. 

After re-watching both ""Star Wars"" and ""Empire"" one after the other for the first time in maybe a decade, all I can say is that at the end of the day, ""Star Wars"" works perfectly for what it is. Unfortunately with ""Empire,"" the peas seem to have become slightly mixed with the porridge.

This movie is as true to the word ""hypnotic"" as hypnosis itself, perhaps even more so. You are engaged in an uncomfortable world of black-and-white industrial skyscrapers, eerily box-like hallways, and a number of other odd settings. You are trapped with absolutely no reprieve; the nightmare of the film becomes your own, and yet, looking away remains an impossible task.

What is most astounding about the world-building in Eraserhead is how nearly every other moment is a reminder of the strange alternative reality you've found yourself in.

2016-09-12,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,2004,https://boxd.it/beCzP,5,,"Dementors aren't very friendly creatures, they seem to have little personal desire beyond that of pleasing their employers by whatever means necessary. Often those means require confiscating someone's soul; not a very friendly gesture.

The dementors are creatures with a dark and mature complexity, something which the previous two ""Potter"" films lacked; ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" champions the dementors.

""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best ""Potter"" film by a long shot, an extraordinarily long shot. I've thought that since the first day I saw it, and after 12 years, that opinion hasn't changed. Alfonso Cuaron renders the abstract magic of the novel in cinematic terms, and the result is breathtaking. Cuaron's camera is the true star of the film, it's constant weaving throughout every scene brings the wizarding world to life in a way which ""Philosopher's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" merely hinted at, and later filmmakers in the franchise could only envy.

""Prisoner of Azkaban"" redefined Harry Potter's world so greatly and so affluently that it immediately became nearly impossible to top. The story and direction are all at the top of their game, creating a total far greater that the sum of their individual parts.

2016-09-19,Apocalypse Now,1979,https://boxd.it/bkxWr,5,,"""Wow, wow, wow-wow.""
""That was one hell of a movie!""

A war film most unlike any other, Apocalypse Now is singular in it's vision of not only the horrors of war, but the ""love,"" the ""freedom,"" and the unequivocal madness of war. This is perhaps the greatest horror film ever made.

I saw this film for the first time today in 70mm at Seattle's most wonderful Cinerama screen. My anticipation for the presentation was high, particularly the 70mm film aspect. However, I must express disappointment, the print has clearly turned pink, and as a result I saw a version of Apocalypse Now bathed in Pink and Red; perhaps actually, the way it was meant to be seen.

Apocalypse Now is a descent into hell, the river curves wide into uncharted and unfriendly waters. The many scattered souls of sinners rush through the infernal waters to the feet of the boat, begging for salvation, yet here, there is none. This is the nature of Apocalypse Now, a genuine nightmare from which escape is impossible. People often cite Brando's ""The horror. . . The horror,"" final line, yet the most resonant in my mind remains the most fervently truthful. ""They were right; never get off the boat.""

Never get off the boat, don't let them get to you. The problem's that they're already here.","70mm, cinerama",2016-09-18
2016-09-21,It's Such a Beautiful Day,2012,https://boxd.it/blVmz,5,,"Though he himself may not realize it, Don Hertzfeldt has inadvertently and simultaneously become both the voice and the greatest influence for my generation of aspiring young filmmakers. He was an artist who started with sophomoric stick-figure animations, then proceeded to use his own wit, proficiency, and genius to create one of the most odd and remarkably sad films of the 21st century.

I've personally followed his career for nearly 11 years now; I'll never forget when a close friend of mine in elementary school showed me a bootleg of Billy's Balloon which he'd found through some sort of woodworks the likes of which I'll never quite know. The anarchic comedy and animated simplicity made it an easy sell to my younger self, yet as I've gotten older, it seems Don's films keep maturing right along side me. 

This culminated with His magnum opus, <i>It's Such a Beautiful Day</i>, which carries more emotional weight in 62 minutes than the vast majority of 3-hour films from the past decade. This film represents Hertzfeldt's first step into a land hitherto unattempted by him; genuine story-telling. It clearly draws inspiration from Kubrick's <i>2001</i> with perhaps a bit of Lynch's <i>Eraserhead</i> as well, yet manages to consistently feel unlike any other film previous to it. Thus, instead of being a retread, Hertzfeldt utilizes his limited resources to create a truly unique and stunningly emotional journey through the fragmented and ambiguous mind of a constantly weary and uncertain character.

Hertzfeldt manages a striking balance of pitch-black humor, ambiguous flashbacks, fragmented story-telling, as well as philosophical and surrealist interludes. All this results in a visually brilliant and undeniably sad meditation on the fragile nature of the human mind, illustrated through the eyes of a broken character, one who can no longer see the world in any ways other than squiggly drawn lines.

I'm not sure what magic dust Hertzfeldt slips into his seemingly simplistic drawings, but it works. Stick-figures are simply not meant to make you feel such a way, yet Hertzfeldt does something brilliant and beautiful with them, creating in the process what I see as one of the finest films ever made.",,2012-02-21
2016-09-23,2001: A Space Odyssey,1968,https://boxd.it/bnt3X,5,Yes,"I need help; I can't stop watching this film. Seeing it in 70mm has absolutely revitalized my obsession with it. And so, I watch it every day; I work and watch it, I write and watch it, I eat and watch it, I sleep and watch it. 

I can't help myself; I love it too damn much. The music, the editing, the special effects, the pure delight and brilliance of it all.

2016-09-24,The Magnificent Seven,2016,https://boxd.it/bojCZ,2.5,,"A sleek, good-looking film which nonetheless remains completely derivative in every sense of the word throughout it's two hour runtime. This is a singularly unengaging work.

When discussing this film, it's difficult to quite put your finger on why such a movie could leave so little impression, but I think I've found the general gist of it. It's simply the same-old style of western filmmaking you've seen, with no interesting characters or emotionally resonant storytelling. The action scenes are cut too quickly and poorly plotted, characters remain distilled archetypes, and the pacing can feel off at points. This movie is just much too bleh, it's the same old stuff with a new coat of paint, and the paint is beginning to chip.

P.S. Ethan Hawke breathes some interest into an otherwise standard (but still up-to-par) cast of characters; he is the best part of the film.",,2016-09-24

I can't stand this movie, and I'm actually very curious now to know how so many folks enjoy it. I personally find the action sequences to be far too overwrought and the characters incredibly dull. Never have I been so bored in such a flurry of confusing CGI imagery. The worst part of it all is how poorly the actors' performances manage to be, even from someone as consistently likable and enjoyable as John Goodman. This is the Wachowskis' lowest point in my opinion; good thing they returned to competency with Cloud Atlas.",,2008-08-24
2016-09-26,2001: A Space Odyssey,1968,https://boxd.it/bqo7B,5,Yes,"<b><i>I'd like to put this controversy to rest</i></b>

2001: A Space Odyssey is my personal favorite film, and I've heard similar statements from many others, however I can't help but notice a recurring asterisk at the end of most peoples' glowing reviews for this movie. Loads of cinephiles out there have given this movie 5 stars, showered it with praise, yet mentioned at the end of their reviews or spoken personally that this film was ""not actually"" one of their favorite films due to it's detached nature and slow pace. 

So I want to put this debate to an end once and for all. If you love this film personally as I do, or if you don't, but still respect it as a work of art, or just flat out hate it, please comment below and elaborate on this issue. Also, don't be afraid of acknowledging your true opinion, we're not gonna judge you if you don't specifically love a classic film such as this. Just let me know your rating, the way you've experienced the film (via Blu-ray or in the theatre) and let me know how YOU really feel about it; this is all about your personal opinion regardless of the film's objective artistry.

2016-10-05,The BFG,2016,https://boxd.it/bxfaP,3,,"This movie made me sad. Why? Not because of it's content, but because of it's creator; director Steven Spielberg. 

We're talking about a masterclass of his craft, of his industry. This is a man whose broken box office records time and time again, while simultaneously creating some of the most wondrous films to ever grace the screen, and defining the period of Hollywood to follow with each new release. Yet as I watched The BFG, I felt weary. The sad truth is that I was simply unmoved, and I'm not sure why. Spielberg's direction is completely on-point; he keeps the film charming,  clever, efficient, and necessarily simplistic. The performances of young newcomer Ruby Barnhill and the now-Oscar-winning Mark Rylance remain subdued and convincing, portraying a calm and mannered friendship unlike what I've seen so often on-screen. 

Despite the pleasure elicited from this initial performance however, The BFG feels like a <i>bit</i> of a film, with the whole being held back. I felt undeniably disatisfied at the end, for reasons I'm not sure I could properly describe. This is a film full of absolutely befuddling and astounding visual effects coupled with likable characters, yet I can't deny how little I felt.

Not every Spielberg film has to be E.T. Or Schindler's List or Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this just felt. . . anti-climactic. It has real magic, but not enough pull, not enough energy, not enough edge. I wanted to love it, but it just didn't seem to come together.","steven spielberg, theatre",2016-10-04
2016-10-05,Kung Fury,2015,https://boxd.it/bxzJb,1.5,,"<b>Yes, I know it's a joke; I just don't find it funny</b>. 

This encapsulates the reason as to why I'm not a fan of ""Kung Fury."" that however, is simply one basis from which one can find themselves disliking this short ""film"". Not only do I personally not find the ""humor"" (references) funny, but I found myself being personally offended by this movie. 

The director and star seems to think his audience driveling and sophemoric fools; he expects us to laugh simply because we are presented with the most generic version of an established style, complete with neon grids, oozes, bandanas, and Kung fu. On top of that, this movie, which was built on a Kickstarter of hopefuls, has absolutely nothing to offer. 

it's fast-paced and well-produced, but also completely cynical, insincere, and pandering. Never have I been so bored and stranded adrift in a sea of 80s cliches; ""Commando"" is a funnier and more authentic movie.

The film's attitude is basically this, ""thank you for funding me, I will now proceed to remind you of every single aspect of the 1980s which you already know about, and this is real funny and you should laugh about it because. . . 80s."" That's about it. 

I'm particularly irritated by the film's absolute lack of any coherency or character, it truly does feel as though it was made by aliens; those who have no idea how to represent humanity, joy, pleasure, or comedy in any sensible way besides, ""hey, do you remember the 80s?"" The particularly shameful fact is that the director's answer to such a question, considering his age, would likely be no.",,2016-10-04
2016-10-06,The Wicker Man,1973,https://boxd.it/byx0Z,4.5,Yes,"""The Wicker Man"" is one of those films whose success seems entirely based on a fluke. This was an excellent story; it reached the right director at the right time, and thus became one of the greatest works of atmospheric horror. 

It's not a perfect film, but it's rough edges serve as unintentional improvements. A quick glance at the filmography of director Robin Hardy shows that these odds and ends were probably not thought of as helping the film; every single aspect simply fell perfectly into place, creating a film rich in eeriness and mood.

""The Wicker Man's"" greatest achievement however is it's ability to completely submerge the audience in an uncomfortable world of pagan customs and rituals. We're left as cold observers, seeing these horrors through the eyes of our authoritative and slightly ignorant protagonist. A few scenes in particular pack a highly uncomfortable punch unlike what it often seen on film; one sequence in particular has our main character nearly seduced by a mysterious woman opposite the wall of his bedroom, showing the full range of this movie's capabilities in manipulating our sense of religious and sexual morals.

""The Wicker Man"" is perhaps a difficult film to talk about due to its straightforward nature, so all I truly have to add to the buckets of praise it's received in the years since release is that, it's a horror movie which works on a unique level. The seemingly inescapable cobblestone walls and streets in which both the audience and protagonist find themselves trapped is so intensely and constantly threatening, it's easy to forget about the oddly out of place and uncertain camerawork, as well as music choices so bizarre that they work simply due to their mismatched folksiness. 

This movie works incredibly for reasons the filmmakers behind it probably couldn't understand, and likely I'll never quite understand either. That's the mystery of The Wicker Man; that's the mystique of The Wicker Man.","35mm, theatre",2016-10-05
2016-10-10,The Shining,1980,https://boxd.it/bCc2X,5,Yes,"There is a spellbinding uncertainty about The Shining which cannot properly be described simply through words. This uncertainty is the inevitably brilliant and fascinating result of Stanley Kubrick's golden dip into the horror genre, and perhaps his everlasting landmark film throughout the massive mainstream moviegoing audience.

However, the unique and disturbing power of The Shining comes from a place which I feel few truly give themselves time to ponder and discuss. 

The undoudbetdly eerie, cold, and distant feel which the movie conveys is executed via what I see as an intensely close-knit tight-wire act. Every character in the film speaks in a way which is just simply, well, not right. 

Everybody is just a little, you know, off. As a result, the audience feels plunged into a situation devoid of comprehensible humanity or familiarity; we are stranded. 

In fact, based on the camerawork, Kubrick seems to fancy his audience the Overlook Hotel itself; with our veiled window into the film's world as our peek through the eyes of an omnipresent, possibly supernatural entity or existence. Kubrick plays with us, our sensibilities, our vulnerabilities, and he does so beautifully.

Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker who constantly succeeded where such an incredibly large amount of others had failed. His horror stylings in The Shining alone have been imitated more times than Kubrick himself could manage to count. Even in critically panned films such as M. Night Shyamalon's The Happening, or Neil LaBute's Wicker Man remake, a tone and feel resembling that of The Shining's was clearly attempted, and yet they failed spectacularly. 

It's because Kubrick simply knew everything without a doubt in his mind. He knew precisely how a scene should be shot, acted, edited, and received for maximum effect. He knew how to coax the audience into false security, only to rock their perceptions once more with nothing but a single cut. He knew how to create the most stunning and memorable images in the history of cinema.

2016-10-14,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,2004,https://boxd.it/bFjJv,5,Yes,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best Harry Potter film by no less than three football field lengths; that's a fact. 

What sets this entry apart from the rest of the franchise is not only it's look, but truly all of the little moments and world-building details. The recurring motif of flickering on candles, the movement of the walls in the shrieking shack, Harry's pulsating motel room just beside a train. These small details are so often overlooked, yet contribute so hugely to the film's energy and life. This is a movie which just lives; now that's a rare compliment.

This movie also brings the wizarding world to life visually in a way earlier entries merely hinted at, and later filmmakers in the series could only envy. Director Alfonso Cuaron's camera weaves through each scene with an amazing urgency, and the film looks absolutely amazing with its cold blue lighting and atmospheric weather. 

This is quite simply the best looking and flowing movie in the ""Potter"" franchise, thus being the most magical and sumptuous; this movie approaches my highly pretentious ""Pure Cinema"" standard more so than any other blockbuster film in recent memory. This is a movie which, in spite of its big budget, remains personalized to it's director's style remarkably. 

Every single aspect of this movie just works so incredibly well; it's thick in atmosphere, beautifully shot, emotionally resonant, and is simply one of the most engaging and sprawling fantasy films of the past 20 years.

Since I first saw this film as a child in 2004, I've been swayed by its nostalgia and magic. However, instead of aging and worsening in my mind, it simply gets better and better every time I see it. Watching the movie in IMAX for the first time in 12 years was a pleasure beyond many I've experienced. Thanks Warner Bros!",,2016-10-13
2016-10-16,Zombeavers,2014,https://boxd.it/bH6Hl,0.5,,"<b>This movie is just, so terrible and so miserable I can't even take it.</b>

It's another horrid attempt at capturing Sharknado levels of ""<i>deliberately</i> so bad it's good,"" and it fails woefully even at that. 

I hate this movie, I hate it so damn much I simply cannot find the words. When Thomas Edison created the kinetoscope in 1891, and helped to found the moving image, could he have possibly imagined that someday his burgeoning technology would be used as a platform to communicate such repugnant cynicism? A grafting of so many deliberate cliches and detestable characters that it creates nothing but a vortex of depressing monotony; and for what? To laugh about it?

2016-10-20,Taxi Driver,1976,https://boxd.it/bKLpj,5,Yes,"<b>This may seem like an odd film to watch around <i>Halloween</i>, but the undeniable truth is that <i>""Taxi Driver"" in fact remains one of the most frightening horror films ever made</i></b>

The only difference is that it swaps out Dracula's gothic castle with the equally gothic and eerily menacing <i>night-lit streets of New York</i>, as well as switching the seductive vampire with the repulsive and self-assaulting Travis Bickle.

From there, the horror evolves naturally through the just off-center early character interactions between Bickle and his romantic-hopeful Betsy, then further in the eventual cesspool of underground filth which the audience finds themselves trapped in. 

At some beguiling moments, the movie appears to be romantic, perhaps even kitsch, yet the feeling appears and disappears just as quickly as the fog flowing through New York's endless streets and alleys; and once they're over, one realizes very quickly that these scenes are just as narratively delusional as Travis' horrifyingly botched heroism.

This is truly a dirty film that asks a great amount from it's viewer, the least of which is to simply endure it.
<i>
</i><i>However, through all this madness, what sill remains the most horrifying prospect of ""Taxi Driver"" is that Travis could in fact be an admirable figure simply for having the gall to dream of being greater and less insignificant than he really is, a fact which most people; sane people, have come to grips with before they're even old enough to practically function in society. But Travis isn't insignificant, at least not in his head, nor is he confidently sane.</i>

This movie is just simply too good for words, every single aspect of the movie; editing, acting, directing, it ALL works, and it works to beautiful and mesmerizing, darkly ironic effect. This movie is absolutely the most brilliant portal Into a madman's confused and fragmented mind ever put to film.

2016-10-21,The Fly,1986,https://boxd.it/bLvLb,3,Yes,"<b><i>""The Fly"" is an example of a movie which, as an ever-so-slightly younger man, appealed to me much more than it does today. </i></b>
<b><i>
</i></b>Upon my first viewing of this film, around the ripe age of about 13 or 14, I fell in love. I'd been taken by the film's convincing chemistry between Goldblum and Davis, as well as it's clever twists on the 1958 original, it's absolutely astounding and unbelievable special creature effects, and it's satisfyingly dark, logical conclusion.

*<i>However</i> 
After a particularly long gap between now and the last time I'd seen the film, I decided to take a look at what I remembered as one of my favorite ""oddball"" horror movies from the 70s and 80s. So I sat down (on my own of course) and watched the movie again;<i><b> </b>and all in a sudden, I was disgusted.</i>
<i>
</i>This movie, despite its impeccable craft, seems utterly pointless in retrospect; purely nothing but an exercise in creative gore and effects for Cronenberg. Not as thoughtful as ""Videodrome,"" yet not as satisfyingly weird as ""Naked Lunch."" Just, absolutely nothing of interest. 

I mean think about this, what is an audience supposed to come out of this film with; a greater understanding of the dangers of uninhibited scientific discovery? A warning about ego and superiority-complex gone wrong? A study of our value on individuality and identity via the concept of cloning/teleporting? Regardless of which you may choose, I think it's fair to say that the various lost jaws and ears in this movie aren't necessarily important in illustrating such concepts; that is, unless the central concept is <i>""oh goy, isn't that just disghousting!""</i>

Even the relationship between Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum seemed to ring false at times. This is particularly prevalent near the film's tragic end; in a final and desperate interaction between Davis and Barely-Goldblum, where a feeling of overwhelming sadness is absolutely needed, Cronenberg chooses to linger on a shot of a head-explosion.

This movie is pure spectacle, and I'm honestly shocked so many have seemingly fallen for it, including me. Yes oh yes, there was a time when all this gore and talk of scientific philosophy was fascinating and dazzling, but there must be a better, more efficient way of getting all these ideas across. 

There's so much I really like about this remake, yet it doesn't seem to land because whatever doesn't work due to Cronenberg's obnoxious tendency toward over-emphasizing gore, seems to fail due to an odd split and detriment in pacing. This ""odd split"" I refer to is seen to be the odd cut between the 50 minute mark, and the remainder of the film. 

First half: establishing Goldblum and Davis, as well as their romance, shared ambitions, and eventual progress toward teleportation; great! Second half: Goldblum transports himself, starts to become aggressive, then in the last half-hour quickly transforms into a giant fly creature-from-the black lagoon bursting through windows and kidnapping women; wait, what?

They just don't mesh; the acceleration of Brundle's disease happens so horrifyingly quick that the audience can't even take the time to fully appreciate its horror. So in the end, all we're left with is a hollow display for some of the best creature effects ever put to film, alongside some amusing moments early on during which Goldblum and Davis work through the scientific process, which by the way, is at least three-thousand times more interesting than a giant fly monster barfing creamy acid onto John Getz' hand.

There are many folks out there who will come to me and say ""Evan, how is it that you give so many movies higher Letterboxd ratings than they should receive while other classics are so low?"" Well, you see, I give movies my rating based purely on how they work for <b>me</b> in what they're trying to do. For example, if I give ""Don't Breathe"" 3 1/2 stars versus 3 stars for ""The Fly,"" it is simply because one works for <i>what it is</i> better than the other (in my opinion). 

So, I can affirmatively say that ""The Fly"" is a retrospective disappointment; it does not retain the quality with which I first observed, and seems to be no more than a hollow, empty genre exercise that approaches ""geek show"" territory.

2016-10-27,Psycho,1960,https://boxd.it/bQyl1,5,Yes,"<b><i>I'm not a real fan of Alfred Hitchcock; this is the truth</i></b>

His films are standard Hollywood fare for their time; he produced no innovative techniques or creative revolutions, all he did was make films in precisely the same manner with which everyone else was making films. 

<i>He was not an auteur</i>

<b>However</b>, the (inevitable) brilliance of Hitchcock lied not in his innovation, but in his subversion. His movies looked like other movies, yet they simply did not <i>feel</i> like those other movies. He had a way of manipulating the standards of then-modern cinema to his will; not transcending, but simply perfecting.

<i>""Psycho"" is quite simply the pinnacle of this</i><i>
</i>
While other critically-acclaimed Hitchcock films such as Rear Window or The Birds could feel, despite their impeccable craft, slight and insignificant, ""Psycho"" manages to create a profoundly opressive, uneasy, and weighty atmosphere, one in which an audience cannot be sure whether or not Norman Bates will crack a smile or stick a knife into his next visitor. One in which those watching cannot ever quite be sure of exactly what they're witnessing and where it is going.

However, the greatest and most overlooked aspect of Psycho is a prevelant detail which Hitchcock's other films seem to lack; presence.

As Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins sit in a basic two-camera shot, reverse shot set-up, the most terrifying moment in the film, a tension is felt, an indescribable, unsure tension. 

The audience attempts to rationalize the thoughts and feelings of the characters they witness on-screen, yet are overcome with an undeniable feeling of being... trapped; trapped in a room full of birds over-head, birds staring with unflinching, hollow gazes, hollow gazes which are staring out of the screen and into the souls of not just the characters, but the souls of the audience, the souls of <i>us. </i>

And below these uncaring, unflinching birds, a madman of unforeseeable proportions calmly sits, offering a sandwich and a bit of toast; because the most terrifying facet of Psycho is not simply that Norman Bates offers a sandwich and toast, but that he offers them to <i>us.</i>",alfred hitchcock,2016-10-26

<i>a filmmaker as humble and ambitious (and powerful) as Christopher Nolan should be treasured...</i><i>
</i>
<i>-as should a film such as ""<b>Interstellar</b>."" </i>

Nolan uses this Epic Science-Fiction Film to show off some of the most remarkable special effects of his time, showing us a version of space which is wholly unique, scientifically accurate, and visually unbelievable all at once. His use of restraint in displaying outer-space visuals is also highly commendable, managing to create a matter-of-fact, eerie coldness to the vacuum which few films manage to capture properly.

Now don't get me wrong though, this film isn't perfect; admittedly, a few decisions made during the writing process seem a bit misguided. Where the story of the movie goes at certain points can feel improper or out-of place, even in spite of a few brilliantly conceived twistings of time and space for the purposes of plot, and ultimate tragedy.

However, even while openly acknowledging these issues, at the very least, the biggest complement I can pay the film is that it felt like a <i>film.</i> A quality which many big-budget, mainstream blockbusters of today seem to lack. Nolan's heady themes and constant, unending, wonderous ambition are a great pleasure to behold on-screen. However, Interstellar resonates most I believe simply due to its very existence in today's saturated Hollywood market. 

Why, well it's because there was a time; a wonderful time, a time when Hollywood filmmakers weren't just ""Tools,"" a time when many Hollywood filmmakers, powerful filmmakers, aspired to be more than just drums marching to the beat of Hollywood executives.

Directors such as Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Sidney Lumet, Francis Ford Coppola, and Alfred Hitchcock; with each film, they began the process by admitting to themselves something wonderful, that they intended to make no less than a masterpiece.

<i>But this priveledge, this right to great cinema from Hollywood has been taken away from us, and replaced with a series of mediocre and at best repetitive franchises. Only a few have successfully held on to Hollywood; Martin Scorcese, Steven Spielberg, David Fincher, Ridley Scott, Robert Zemeckis, Denis Villeneuve, and of course Christopher Nolan.</i>

However, what STILL manages to set Chris Nolan apart from the rest is his extraordinarily ability to <i>want.</i> Even a fantastic director such as David Fincher unfortunately seems to stick to relatively safe projects; films with the standard 3-act structure, melodrama, and all human concerns of the immediate, tangible variety. 

Christopher Nolan does not stick to such projects; he is a filmmaker who truly <i>wants</i>, with each new release, to create nothing less than a masterpiece; nothing less than a movie which could potentially transcend the art form, and <b>that</b> is something which should be treasured.",,2016-11-02

However, sometimes a movie comes along mixing pessimism and optimism so brilliantly that it defies common sense. A film which bridges the gap between the sanitized mainstream media and genuine art...

<i>WALL-E is such a film</i>

Now I know this must sound horrifically cliche, but this movie is absolutely important to me and my love of film. It's release coincided with my first visit to the Seattle International Film Festival, around which I must've been 8 or so, and this film reminded me of what cinema, even on such a large, mainstream scale, could truly be.

Pixar's achievment with this film is a magnificent one, managing to get away with a nearly <b>wordless</b> first act, and at that, a hopelessly yet fascinatingly depressing story.

It's science fiction premise is genuinely intriguing, and not on the watered-down ""kids movie,"" scale, but truly by the level of ""Serious Sci-Fi."" In fact, it's so thoughtful and intriguing that, even nearly a decade later and (admittedly only <i>near)</i> adulthood, I found myself asking such constant and vivid questions just based off of the dynamics of the story; Wall-E himself is such a saddening character. 

If one stops to think, than they'll realize how macabre this concept is; if Wall-E is one of thousands and millions of identical robots, then why is <i>he</i> the only remaining? How does he manage to have seemingly innate human curiosity and passions? Does he ever feel lonely? Does he ever stop to realize his insignificance in a world so much vaster and more understanding than he could ever hope to be? And how do I care so much for a small robot whose purpose is basically to be a piece of propaganda for a massively unethical, globe-trotting corporation?

This is an absolutely rare and precisely necessary movie; it's a smart science fiction film with astounding visuals and animation, intelligent, impressively slow-paced storytelling, and a reoccurring use of ""Hello Dolly"" that borders on the downright brilliant.

This is a beautiful and important movie; honestly, I feared that watching this film after so many years, it might've been worse than I remembered, perhaps<i> much</i> worse. But the moment the film began, and I heard ""Hello Dolly"" run over images of our solar system in its truest, coldest, loneliest and most magnificent form, I was reassured. Yes, WALL-E is the greatest children's film ever created, and if not, it would play second and third fiddle to no less than ""Pinocchio"" and ""Snow White.""

<b>Note</b>: The main complaint many have with this film is its slight imbalance between the first act being followed by a ramp-up of energy and mania. My answer to this (slight) problem is that this ""imbalance"" seems apparent simply due to the undeniable reality that the first 30-or-so minutes could perhaps be one of the greatest Sci-fi openings ever, while the rest of the film follows suit with a more energetic and comedic tone.

For such an Iconic film from such an acclaimed director, it seems that this movie simply does not measure up in cinematic respectability to the degree with which even the most generous of cinephile might suspect, especially based on it's popularity, which persists even to this day.

And yet, <i>Scarface</i> is not <i>The Godfather; no,</i> but rather it's louder, sleazier, less elegant, more violent, and coked-up nephew. It's a film which grabs you by the balls, whereas <i>The Godfather</i> slowly and carefully tugs you by the balls, not to mention, in a more rewarding way overall as well (apologies for the vulgar wording).

Yet <i>Scarface</i> still persists, insinuating itself in the hearts and minds of cinephiles everywhere simply because it's the under-appreciated Crime-Epic Masterpiece; you know, the one which critics don't like; the one which the AFI and DGA constantly ignore year-after-year, and on top of all that, the one Gene Siskel gave his brutal <i>Thumbs-Down</i> to.

Though despite all these mixed messages, I settled on finally watching <i>Scarface,</i> and along the way, assuring myself through the whole time that my opinion would have to be unique from the two main camps of this film; those who think it's a masterpiece, and those who feel it's a B-movie essentially.

In conclusion, I can come to the consensus that it is a very, very good film which simply <i>inches</i> towards ""Masterpiece"" territory, but never quite reaches it due to what I perceive as De Palma's enslavement to his own style, even in spite of it flying in the face of his individual scenes landing emotionally.

I wanted to love this film, I wanted to say that it deserves ""Classic"" status and that it was a masterpiece, but it was simply plagued by too many loose plot lines, inconsistent authorial intent, and a general lack of any strong human redemptive qualities to latch onto.

Perhaps the biggest issue with <i>Scarface</i> however, is its cynicism and exaggerated world, which seems to emphasize the loudest and sleaziest of humanity, even in places where some sort of genuine, emotional connection is desperately needed.

There are moments in this film which soar, perhaps even more so than any moment in ""<i>The Godfather,""</i> and yet I still cannot find the entire experience worth a 5-star writing, even in spite of my love for this film, it's just not quite there.

And yet, something <i>has</i> changed, I'm not sure if it's me, or the movie, but <i>Eraserhead</i> seems to get better and worse all at the same time, every time. It goes up, down, left, right, sideways, upways, diagnolly, laterally.... Yet one thing always remains; my eyes can't leave the screen.

My first experience was hazy, confusing, disorienting, and above all unpleasant. I simply did not like or enjoy the film. Years later, I watched it again and, I liked it a lot more. The 3rd time was not too long after, with a still mutual feeling from the last viewing.

Now, this impression I retained for another year or so, before sitting down again to watch the film just last night. All in a sudden, it... worked. The film started, and even though I'd seen it all before, I became transfixed; sucked into my Television.

The seemingly nonsensical opening, which previously had seemed a bit boring and awkward, was now ominous and breathtaking. The elevator sequence was hilarious, followed by an unexplainable sequence involving hair sprouting out from a radiator, which caught me off-guard for the fourth time somehow.

Then the film continued on, and on, and on, and on, until suddenly, I woke up. I looked around, and I realized the film was over; I had woken up from the film. Suddenly, I understood the cult appeal, I understood the groundbreaking nature of this movie, it all simply flooded into me like an open reservoir of bloody filth, and I was engulfed in the disgusting majesty of this disturbing nightmare. 

<i>Eraserhead</i> is not meant to be understood, it was not made to be understood. It was made to be studied; studied and analyzed in the way Freud studied and analyzed dreams, the subconscious, and the human experience. It's an intellectual playground, and that's one of the highest compliments I think a film can receive.

There have been many films <i>about</i> the subconscious, <i>about</i> dreams, <i>about</i> the human experience, and yet <i>Eraserhead</i> manages to do something singularly unseen; it simply, <i>is,</i> the subconscious; it is the nightmare from which you cannot escape.

It truly is strange, the film was released to a highly mixed response, with many labeling it as a ""childlike"" attempt on the part of Spielberg to capture his close friends' style, while a few saw it as one of the most ambitious and wholesome sci-fi films to see a wide release in many years.

I myself felt, at least initially, dissatisfied with the final film, seeing the flaws which many at the time observed. However, <i>A.I.</i> has proved itself to be a truly Kubrick film for one overwhelming reason, one which few can deny...

<b><i>It has genuinely improved with time</i></b><b><i>
</i></b>
Watching the film again, it continues to grow in stature in my mind, with every scene landing as poignantly as the one before. Even the opening scene, which has William Hurt delivering what I first saw as a clumsily sentimental piece of exposition, has transformed through the years into a cathartically ironic and thoughtful sequence. 

Without the audience immediately realizing it, this entire scene contradicts the remainder of the film in ways which Spielberg may not have even recognized, when meanwhile Kubrick stood slyly in the corner giggling about the irony of it all.

This entire juxtaposition of Kubrick's ironic structure and Spielberg's often sentimentalized approach is what manages to create one of the most bafflingly genius collaborations between any two artists in the history of cinema. 

Like all truly Kubrick films, <i>A.I.</i> really does change with stunning transformation upon each subsequent viewing, becoming even more ironic and strangely tragic with each watch.

So who knows, maybe if I give it another 10 years, this might be up there with ""Clockwork Orange,"" and I mean that in the most genuine way possible.

Whether the filmmakers realized it or not, they were, throughout filming, inadvertently capturing the epitome of artistic insanity; a man so driven by brilliant music and performance that he almost forgot how to function like an ordinary human being.

It's rare when a movie truly jumps out of the screen it inhabits, elevating itself to a place of importance in the mind of it's viewer which is wholly undeniable. The film is violent, difficult, perhaps even wretched, and yet you keep watching. 

There's something there that's difficult to describe, but regardless of your moral views, it is there. ""A Clockwork Orange"" runs backwards and contradictory to itself, ultimately representing the title superbly.

After I finished watching the film for the first time, I was stunned; it contains one of those endings in which, as the final frame closes, the entire weight of the movie is undeniably felt. Then I had a revelation. I thought, ""what could this film have looked like being directed by anyone else besides Stanley Kubrick?"" It occurred to me, a typically dramatic director would read the script and immediately think, 

<i>""hmm, well, this is the story of a vile, hateful psychopath who is denied his own justifiable punishment by society's political and moral dillusions."" Then they'd move on, ""how do we show our main character? Well, he's a violent psychopath, the audience couldn't possibly identify, the camera remains distant, his character is inscrutable; we don't so much follow him as much as we observe him. We see how Alex ruins the world around him, how all are innocent victims, and how he should be punished. What else could the film be?"" </i>

<i>Then the director figures out what the tone should be, ""Well, dark, disturbing of course. Lots of darkness, lots of shadows, dark techno music, we see the inherent darkness of the world this story inhabits, the anarchy, the destruction.""</i> 

So there you go, this film would be released, be praised by critics as the masterful story of a disturbed teen and the moral questions concerning his actions and lack of punishment. It would also probably win best picture and be called ""a modern classic"". The film would be forgotten due to its ultimately dull look and pace, lack of genuine style, and surface-level analysis. 

But, that didn't happen, Kubrick made it. The film was controversial and dangerous, and despite being generally upbeat and even humorous at times, is even darker than this alternate version I've proposed. Kubrick is smarter, more biting, more humorous, he sees how obviously the story could potentially be presented, and subverts it. The film doesn't observe Alex, it MAKES US ALEX. We see his victims as emotionless cutouts, older men and women whom we see at a distance. 

Just imagine, an alternate version of the infamous ""Singin' in the Rain"" rape scene, with an almost theatrical wide shot replaced with intensified close-ups of the victims, Alex leering disgustingly into their personal spaces; his slime completely evident, as a dark drone plays beneath the horror. But no, it's Singin' in the Rain, emotionless, dead, and all the more disturbing and self-reflective for it.

2016-12-16,Wild at Heart,1990,https://boxd.it/cyQVJ,2.5,,"<i>*Well, it's a certain Lynch; no, a definite Lynch. </i>

That's the <b>best</b> possible way I can figure to begin a review for such an uncertain film as this. I liked it, yet I didn't. It wasn't boring, yet I nearly fell asleep; no one can be entirely sure, myself included.

<i>Wild at Heart</i> is quite an odd film; not due to the typical ""Lynchian"" trademarks of intense sound-design, reoccurring and seemingly unkikely motifs, surrealism, etc, but due to it's unwavering devotion towards it's two main leads. Their love remains genuine and palpable, a singularly unexpected result from a Lynch film I must admit. 

This authenticity is particularly enjoyed when contrasted with the blood splatters, decapitations, and sexual assaults present in nearly every other scene; it's a beautiful combination. Or perhaps, I suppose, a bit uncomfortable. 

Now I must clarify, this vulgarity, this ""edginess"" is clearly intentional, however my problems come in the form of this films tendency to confuse such acts of horrific violence for comedy, or perhaps vice versa. Take for example, the scene in which Harry Dean Stanton finds himself brutally tortured and murdered for what seems to be absolutely no reason by a character whose motivations we barely manage to understand anymore than we do the burnt ends of Sailor and Lula's cigarettes. 

This is a dim and hopeless scene (or at least it appears to be); however, the final gunshot to the back of this poor character's head is followed not by a moment of introspection, but by an abrupt smash cut to a large yellow sign which reads ""Big Tuna Texas."" If this is not an attempt to <b>immediately</b> subvert the vile taste in an audiences' mouth following such a sequence of brutality, than I'm not quite sure what the meaning of a <i>cut</i> even is anymore.

With this rapid confusion of tone and intention, a cloud began to wake over me as I watched <i>Wild at Heart;</i> an oppressive force which could be interpreted both individually and simultaneously as a subconscious sixth sense and a slight whispering voice, both of which and all of which pestered me nearly every moment which followed the next. 

I couldn't help but find myself a bit bored and bit distant, an absolute shame considering my love of the Lynch; hell, I'm even one of the few who can say they enjoyed ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me."" 

Yet even in spite of all these... things, this whole film is just too far in the opposite direction from even that direction which Lynch moves (this is likely just left of ""upper-right diagonal""). The whole thing is just wild at heart and weird on... well, you know.

2016-12-18,Close Encounters of the Third Kind,1977,https://boxd.it/cAsSl,5,Yes,"<i>Curiosity is not simply an emotion, but an anchor; a privilege, and a virtue. </i>

It's the thoughts spurred by curiosity which have led our species confidently along a path from which it was always destined to walk, but could not find the motivation for without the privilege of curiosity.

<b><i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> is a film that treasures curiosity</b>

<i>It allows it's audience one of the greatest privileges offered by any film; the privilege to wonder. </i>

The privilege to wonder past our preconceived limitations of the human experience, and to truly believe in that which can only become real if we allow ourselves to dream. 

And when the seemingly unbelievable is given credence, there's no telling how far humans can reach.

Steven Spielberg had made only three feature films before 1977, but with this one, something just clicked, and as a result he created what I can easily call perhaps one of the finest Sci-Fi films ever made.

<i>Close Encounters</i> is the most joyously optimistic science-fiction film I've ever seen, and it stands alone as a representation of when Hollywood and art-house sensibilities meet to create a masterpiece.

Like Kubrick's <i>2001 and</i> Tarkovsky's <i>Solaris, Close Encounters</i> is an adult sci-fi film that asks for you to take it seriously; the only difference is that instead of stepping back and inspiring awe, it leans in for a quiet whisper, asking for nothing more than an appreciation of the universe surrounding you.

2016-12-20,Star Wars,1977,https://boxd.it/cDmhf,5,Yes,"<i>There was a time when movies were allowed to be movies...</i>

when sci-fi blockbusters could be weird and strange and all the oddest colors of a technicolor rainbow. 

And though this time has passed in favor of a more malevolently regimented system of intertexuality and board-room executive nightmares, one film stands apart as a testament to this ashamedly bygone era; most ironic is the fact that the film has, in recent years, been turned to as a sort of scapegoat for this apparent lack of luster in Hollywood's modern-day blockbuster monotony.

This film of course is the immortal, the original, one and undeniably only, <i>Star Wars;</i> a film so true to the word awesome that its once-disconcerting title has now become synonymous with a cultural landmark which stretches far across the galaxy and a perhaps a little to the left.

It's almost impossible to describe the appeal of such a simplistic and wonderous story told in the most spectacular, romantic way possible. The pacing of the film is just perfect, it tells the story with surprising diligence, still allowing for moments of pure wonder to occur. Its characters are iconic, and it's story is beautifully yet movingly simplistic.

However, everything I just described is still not even close to encapsulating what makes this film so special. It's just so difficult to tell; a magic aura surrounds it perhaps, I'm not quite sure. It's just wonderful and memorable every step of the way without reprieve.

Perhaps though, the best thing I can really say about it, the specific appraisal which can be given to this blockbuster film and no others (not even any subsequent films in the continuing Star Wars saga), is that it is simply a...

<i>movie</i><i>
</i>
A movie which had the ability to delicately capture the hearts and minds of the general public in an innocent and loving way, unlike any other before it.

A movie which was made not for massive sums of cash, not to inflate public awareness of what would ultimately become an unstoppable brand of revenue and worship, but most magically for something which today's audiences seem to have forgotten in a flurry of interconnected universes, callbacks, repeats, and resurrections.

2016-12-23,Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me,1992,https://boxd.it/cG1l7,2,,"I'm having trouble reconciling my feelings for <i>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me;</i> it's undoubtedly a film cut from some sort of brilliant and mysterious cloth, yet I simply cannot lie to myself about the despicably cynical attitude with which I can't help but feel this movie was made.

This is especially shocking since David Lynch is a director who I typically adore, yet as I delve into the works he was producing in the early 90s, it seems clear that he had some sort of creative stunting at the time. His ""<i>Twin Peaks""</i> phenomenon was in full swing, and as a result it seems <i>Wild at Heart</i> and <i>Fire Walk with Me</i> were faintly produced from the slightest amount of visionary strength which he could muster at such a dizzying time.

However, between these two films, <i>Fire Walk with Me</i> has got to be my absolute least favorite Lynch film, an award which I had just previously given to <i>Wild at Heart,</i> but now my cynicism has taken over and my hatred has begun to grow...

And yes, I <i>hate</i> this movie,

I think it's a purposeless exercise in David Lynch's own artistic will, as he endlessly berates his audience with a shocking and unusual contempt. This contempt is evident in the film's clearly deliberate lack of immediate connection to the TV show, as well as its frustrating structure and lack of clarity.

Right from the beginning, Lynch negates the potential hope for a reasonably well-connected spin-off from the television show by opening with first a smashed TV (a clear signal), then by the introduction of two uncharismatic and extraordinarily dull FBI agents, neither of whom have been seen in the TV show, and neither of whom have the same charm as Kyle Maclachlan's Dale Cooper.

Even David Lynch's own Gordon Cole doesn't have an opportunity to shine. In fact, nearly all opportunities for comedic charm have been abandoned for incessant amounts of depression and gloom. 

Now don't get me wrong, this doom and gloom is necessary for a story about Laura Palmers' final days. However, the greater question becomes not ""should this story have had more laughs?"" But ""should this story have been told at all?"" The answer to the later of which is, in my opinion, absolutely no.

There was a mystique about Laura Palmer's murder in the original <i>Twin Peaks</i> TV show; it was an enigma which we knew could probably never be fully understood nor comprehended and digested easily. Yet Lynch and co made the odd decision to create a film whose entire purpose was to literally show in the most obvious and disgusting manner the murder of Laura Palmer? 

<i>I'm sorry Lynch, but... What?</i>

<i>You could've attempted to jumpstart Ronnie Rocket for the 15th time, yet instead you settled for spending 10 million dollars on a Twin Peaks film adaptation which was essentially doomed financially and even critically right from the start?</i>

<i>(Sigh)</i>, now to be fair, there are aspects of this film which are fascinating to me and also exceedingly brilliant. The ""dream"" sequences are, even at their most indulgent, an impressive surrealist landscape worth admiring. 

In addition, the constant feeling of dread so typical of great horror cinema is present, with Lynch providing his own strange version of Laura's hellish world through an endless supply of subtle editing techniques and recurring use of subtitles, all of which are essentially used as opportunities of daring on behalf of Lynch for the audience; daring to even attempt to solve this film's very well-crafted and perplexing puzzle.

However, unlike <i>Eraserhead</i> or <i>Mulholland Drive,</i> <i>Fire Walk with Me</i> provides little incentive to pursue such a thematic investigation because, even once it's vault has been cracked, and it's secrets revealed, the only underlying conclusion one can ultimately come to is that pain and sorrow equals misery and more misery.

In essence, that's all <i>Fire Walk with Me</i> is; misery, and more misery. There's no intrigue, no fascination, no hypnotic quality, just misery and discomfort with little to no foundation.

It's without a doubt in my mind, the absolute worst David Lynch film I've seen, and I only dislike it more with each subsequent viewing.

So thank you very much Lynch, now please hand me back my <i>Garmonbozia</i> if you wouldn't mind.

<b>*Note</b>: <i>Cheryl Lee's performance is, quite shockingly, one of the greatest and most wide-eyed interpretations of a broken, in-desperation character I've seen in any film ever, which evidently makes me hate the final film even more for wasting her operatic and stunning performance on an indulgent exercise in surrealist misery and terror.</i>","harry dean stanton, david lynch",2016-12-22
2016-12-26,Blue Velvet,1986,https://boxd.it/cJk7T,4.5,Yes,"<i>Substance is a word I value quite highly when I discuss the films I love...</i>

It's the meat which holds a film together, a bit like the elmers glue you might see the employers at a pottery shop utilizing, or like taffy sticking between two opposing thumbs. 

Substance is what gives films a landing pad onto which every other visceral and stylistic quality can be stacked on top of. In essence, it's the necessary bedrock.

However, some films in particular manage to get away with the ultimate crime; little or even no substance. Yet even in spite of this seemingly apparent fact, they still manage to delight and exhilarate in odd and immdeiate ways.

<i>Blue Velvet</i> is a film which, in my mind, has no pretense of being anymore than what it is; a fun, well-crafted, pulpy, and witty shocker of a mystery. It's surrealist pleasure from top to bottom, with an affective roller-coaster ride of a story, and an undeniably legendary performance from Dennis Hopper.

<i>Is it a masterpiece? No. </i>
<i>Is it Lynch's best? I don't think so.</i>

However, it's still a ton of eerie, unpredicable, and exacting fun. 

I still can't deny though that, in sharp contrast with <i>Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive,</i> and <i>Lost Highway</i>, all of which get better with each subsequent viewing, <i>Blue Velvet</i> grows not any worse in my mind, but let's just say, it's simplicity becomes more and more apparent.

I say this because I hear many claiming <i>Blue Velvet</i> as Lynch's best film, to which I strongly object due to, well, what I've just said. The simplicity is apparent and even intentional; right from the start of the film we're presented with the intentionally static and innocent portrayal of 50s/80s suburbia, which of course sits atop the mostly silent, but still ever-present undergrowth of Beatles and insects.

However, Lynch does not criticize or subvert the peaceful suburbia above with this clear metaphor, he's merely contrasting it's beauty and innocence with the dirty and insect-like underbelly of which we later discover is reflected in human form by Frank and co. 

Lynch communicates this idea brilliantly, however the idea itself is rather straightforward. That's the film in a nutshell; brilliantly told, but undeniably straight-forward.

2016-12-27,8½,1963,https://boxd.it/cL9Ij,5,,"<i>Art is such a strange thing, nearly as strange to watch in some cases as it is to create.</i>

However, what people don't acknowledge about the very essence of the concept of ""art"" is just how loose the aforementioned term can often be. 

<i>""I really have nothing to say, but I want to say it all the same.""</i>

This quote, as well as the ultimate messiness of ""art"" which I am attempting so heavily to impose is what drives <i>8 1/2. </i>

It is what lends meaning to the meaningless, even in spite of the fact that the film's genius in and of itself lies not in it's ultimate purpose, but in it's astoundingly truthful confession that, perhaps, there is no purpose, nor genius to be found within any film or any art, none except that which the individual may bring of their own will, without even realizing they've done so.

It's remarkable that a filmmaker as seemingly absorbed into the fantasy of his own craft as Fellini could showcase such an acknowledgment of this fantasy, particularly at a time and in a place when so many Nouvelle Vague directors claimed their films to <i><b>be</b></i> reality.

But no, Fellini was more cutting, and more assertive. He knew the irony in such a portentous and woefully pretentious film movement, and as a result, had.... Absolutely nothing to say.

2016-12-29,The Elephant Man,1980,https://boxd.it/cNhY9,4.5,Yes,"<i>*The line between sentimentality and the genuine sadness and misery that life offers can often times be razor thin. </i>

Few films showcase the latter in a greater fashion than The Elephant Man. David Lynch's first Hollywood outing is an atmospheric work of art, an exercise in tone and feeling similar in many ways to that of Lynch's sophemore effort Eraserhead. 

One crucial seperation however is the <b>use</b> of mood; the beautiful black and white photography of The Elephant Man takes on a greater purpose in the story, not only coming to represent the period and world properly, but in showing us the darkness with which John Merrick's world was full of. 

A world in which no person can properly look you in the eye without being overcome with such profound sorrow just at your very existence, and even then, it still remains better than being confronted with those who'll laugh and sneer. 

Lynch's masterwork concerns itself with two non-submergable pillars of importance; 

<b>1)</b> Creating an engaging world made up of London's dim cobblestone streets, barely lit by candlelight and fog; mysterious yet opaque. And 
<b>2)</b> Showing the undoubtedly and undeniably depressing life of John Merrick, as well as the great positivity with which he projected onto it. 

The film is successful for these reasons, although what must be additionally mentioned is the films excellent pace, appropriately odd use of sound, and an absolutely astounding performance by John Hurt, who miraculously transcends his pounds of make-up, ultimately creating one of the most undoudebtly tragic characters in film history, and perhaps even reality. 

He did not choose to live this, and yet he must.

2017-01-13,Annie Hall,1977,https://boxd.it/d96mn,5,Yes,"I’m a cynic, and yet I've just had a profound experience the depths of which cannot be delineated into a comprehensive, sociological/philosophical language; it falls apart under scrutiny.

I feel aware of my Letterboxd audience of lovingly pretentious film students, and am confident that they don't want to hear me yabber on about a simple Woody Allen film called <i>Annie Hall</i> that doesn't need to be said is great anymore than it already has been said because everyone knows that it already is, even if they haven't seen it.

Hell, even I knew how great <i>Annie Hall</i> was before I'd seen it, so when I finally got around to visiting my local independent theatre to watch a brief revival screening, the process was simple. 

I sat down, stared at the screen, laughed a lot, then when it ended I exclaimed, ""wow, everybody was right, that has got to be one of the best films I've ever seen."" I then checked my regularly updated Letterboxd list of ""All Time Favorite Films,"" and thought ""oh, I should probably rank this some place where it can be well-recognized;"" I placed it in position 37.

And there it sat, collecting dust in the furthest reaches of my cinephiliac consciousness, hidden somewhere between my lost memories of childhood and the imposing satin sheets which used to hang above my bedroom walls.

Much time passed, with many films seen and even more passively witnessed, I made the odd choice to re-watch <i>Annie Hall</i> as I stayed home sick due to a fever (yes, I am a naiïve high school student, deal with it). And as I watched the film, I laid on my couch laterally, with all doors and windows shut tightly...

<i>And it was a different film...</i>

Not only did I watch the film, I felt I’d lived the film.

And not only did I laugh at the film, I chortled with the most classical glee.

In fact, I began to <i>feel</i> the film so deeply that when it came to the end, I experienced a moment which I have seldom enjoyed in all of my movie buff lifespan. 

For some unfathomable reason, a cosmic force washed over me and I... just sorta, you know. My eyes got misty, and I very nearly cried, and no movie, or in fact, <i>thing</i> in general has managed to get me near crying in years. Yet some <i>thing</i> emerged nonetheless as I watched <i>Annie Hall. </i>

Some <i>thing</i> I had railed against for as long as I could remember, and no longer felt like tossing aside. It was the <i>thing</i> which had followed me down corridors and side-streets and into concert halls; cinemas and metropolitan centers alike. It was a sort of death which I dreaded - it was fidelity.

The need for companionship... for sympathy, was haunting me. It was the ineffable need to be human. The need one feels when they suddenly realize how they’re worth is not only validated by themeselves but by their value to another. I had felt for the first time what it is to belong to humanity.

So when I nearly cried, it was a moment so profoundly transforming that I realized I was not just precipitating tears because of my appreciation for the film technically or the awesomeness of what I was seeing, but because I was genuinely reflecting on my own life, my own relationships with people; not just far away existential concepts, but my fellow humans with whom I felt I could truly identify. 

I thought about those who I had known, those who I had appreciated... those who I thought I could love but wasn't yet ready for. Those with whom I had fought and left, those with whom I had compromised and stayed; humans. All these miscellaneous thoughts and feelings are all the more revelatory coming from me because that which permeates the recesses of my mind is not often people and humans, but concepts.

<i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> has been my favorite film for years, not necessarily because it’s the film I respond to the most, but because it’s the one which most fascinates me from an intellectual standpoint. It is disconnected from the human, and I now realize how comfortable that existential separation is to me. <i>

<i>Annie Hall<i> has made me realize my change in character - that I can no longer refute the human. It is a film so profoundly representative of real, human people that it in and of itself could easily be read as the ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" of human experience.

<i>Annie Hall</i> is the first film in my life since <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> which I feel has truly signaled a genuine maturation of my person, reminding me with a joy and wit unprecedented anywhere else in cinema that I have an unequivocal right to be me, and to hope that I can find meaning in the simple human interactions we're all gifted with right from the start of our lives.

In essence, <i>Annie Hall</i> reminds me that I'm getting older, and that the foremost priority in my life must be the human, regardless of how fervently I deny it. My existence can be clarified so long as I find, and perhaps even provide, joy and peace in my relationships with others, whether intellectual or emotional.

Ironically, I've never been left quite so wordless...

I am overwhelmed by the power of this film. I'm not sure if I hate it or if I love it, but all I can say is that when addressing a film such as ""Silence,"" the title alone becomes a loaded word.

I suppose truthfully the only reaction anyone can have with this film is based purely, and I mean purely and completely on their own set of beliefs. ""Silence"" reaches past the point of objective cinematic criticism, and into a rarely seen no mans land of completely personalized, subjective interpretation.

Without becoming too self-indulgent or overbearing, it must be stated that I personally am not a religious person, nor have I ever been. 

I grew up in a mostly reform Jewish household, and thus my personal reaction should theoretically be less strong or divisive than it would likely be for others.

And yet, I still cannot help but find myself in shock at the sheer audacity of such a film as this. It builds and builds until it finally reaches what is, arguably, a muddled conclusion which seems to contradict itself when placed alongside the majority of the film.

...or does it?

or does it not...?

I don't know, and it seems no one knows, possibly not even Martin Scorsese, whose own personal uncertainty might've inadvertently helped create a film unlike any other. 

A film wherein self-doubt itself is baked into its very essence, as it's narrative, and characters, all seem to vary wildly and inconsistently almost by some sort of inadvertent design.

For now, having just recovered from the film, I refuse to give it a star rating.

Although I suppose I should take a step back first and clarify; <i>musically</i> moving, not emotionally. This is a film which dares you not to stand up and sway your hips alongside David Byrne and his company of heads.

Jonathon Demme's filmic translation of Byrne's concert conception is absolutely stunning, and actually manages to convey a sense energy by lacking excessive coverage and quick cutting. As David Byrne himself once said, Jonathon Demme's brilliance in documenting this concert is in his ""knowing what not to do,"" rather than assaulting the viewer with an overbearing visual presentation.

And somehow, that subtlety works. I remember the first time I watched the film after many years of reading about its spectacle, I was a bit confused. I'd expected to see something which this film wasn't; a narrative. I was sort of expecting <i>The Last Waltz</i> starring The Talking Heads. 

But of course, this film has much less narrative than <i>The Last Waltz</i>, and yet, is all the better for it.

As I watched the film, I had a bit of an immaculate realization; that music could be dialogue, that music <i>is</i> dialogue only told through motion and pitch rather than a coherent verbal language.

The beauty of <i>Stop Making Sense</i> is not in it's brilliant rendition of this Talking Heads concert, but in its simple yet profound understanding that music speaks for itself.

There's no denial that the plot isn't even close to coherent, and that anyone who attempts to claim otherwise is clearly making a moor of themselves.

And yet, an appeal still remains for me, separate even from the fact that I grew up intently with this illogical and immeasurably nutsy film on VHS; a tape I watched so much in fact that today it skips wildly from scene to scene due to such heavy and frequent rewind.

Yes, as a child, I simply couldn't get enough of such a film, but then again I suppose how could anybody? Peter Fonda gives his most committed and drug-addled performance since ""Easy Rider,"" meanwhile Alec Baldwin gives his best performance to date, with a monologue about ""magic dust"" easily rivaling that of his infamous ""brass balls"" speech in both writing and execution.

The special effects are equally dazzling; the island of Sodor is brought to life not with poorly rendered CGI from it's era of burgeoning (the late 90s), but with an array of charming models, opticals, and large-scale sets, each giving off a whiff of antiquated charm.

And then of course, there's Thomas the anthropomorphized tank engine himself, whose stilted expressions and thinly sketched child-like persona render him as something of a charming wind-up toy.

All these bits of charm are irrefutably enhanced by a plot which ardently refuses to bend to logic, instead opting for a story as complex in structure as ""Catch-22,"" and as baffling in delivery as Bergman's ""Hour of the Wolf.""

All told, ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"" could easily qualify as a film within ranking of ""2001"" and ""Eraserhead"" in its evolution of the cinematic experience, a film whose exterior sheen as a charming children's film eventually gives way to existentialist beauty, and reveals an understanding of Sartre's views on artistic futility, Freud's insights into childhood latency, and of course most importantly, the greed of Hollywood producers in profiting from a successful PBS television program.

2017-05-06,The Straight Story,1999,https://boxd.it/h0x5h,5,,"<b>Out of Time</b>

So much of life in the 21st century has become a competition; who can showcase greater aggression than the other? Our culture has evolved to a point in which our icons can do nothing but shout at us in one direction. 

The world has caught itself in a river rapid moving so fast, that not one person it seems has found time to stop and breathe. The modern landscape of entertainment has reflected that fact; Netflix doesn't require much consequence or reflection, at least not as much as a calming drive to the local Blockbuster rental facility might.

Then, there's <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Straight Story</i>, a film which <i>is </i>that reflective drive to the Blockbuster. It waits and waits, and all the while enjoys that waiting. This is a film which remembers that the moments between moments is what constitutes a life.

The sheer banality of <i>The Straight Story</i> is what I find particularly moving, that and the fact that such tenderness is being induced from a filmmaker whose talent once seemed exclusive to elephant men and self-mutilating puppetry. 

If anything, this is the film which proves David Lynch as a filmmaker capable of anything. His trademark cerebral pace and filmic mannerisms prove wonderfully endearing in telling a story so quaint, so wonderful, so true to the sincerity of life.

In my opinion, <i>The Straight Story</i> is very nearly Lynch's best film simply because it paints a portrait rarely seen in film, that of a man and a lifestyle so unabashedly genuine and slow that only a 1966 John Deere Lawn Tractor could act as it's literal and metaphorical vehicle.

When reflecting upon <i>The Straight Story, </i>I often enjoy comparing it to a similarly acclaimed film which was released pointedly in the same month, <i>Fight Club. </i>

Now, <i>Fight Club</i> is a much-oft cited landmark work of late-90s cinema. It speaks to a certain decade, and a certain mindset which rings true with an entire generation. It's also a film which wallows in loud-mouthed nihilism, narcissicism, and violence. <i>Fight Club</i> has a clear agenda, and throughout its runtime leaps and bounds at the audience unflinchingly with it.

Alvin Straight on the other hand, well he doesn't much care to get in anybody's way. He'd much rather quietly sit on his Lawn Tractor, and stare up into the stars.

""The worst past about getting old,"" he says, ""is remembering when you were young.""

Damn straight. 

Congratulations David Lynch, you've sincerely made the least cynical film of all time, and I'll love it until the day I get old and die.","harry dean stanton, david lynch",2017-05-05
2017-05-29,Being There,1979,https://boxd.it/hw8sJ,5,Yes,"Recently I've had a bit of a revelation about the art of the cinema, and it's something which I couldn't have foreseen at a slightly younger age.

This revelation is perhaps one which relates profoundly to André Bazin, a man whose musings on film had up until recently seemed foreign to me.

A film should be objective?
The director invisible?
The shots long and the editing slow?

How could this constitute great cinema?

Denying myself of this mentality, I approached <i><b>Being There</b></i> on my first viewing with a certain myopic cynicism. 

""<i>The story of a child-like old man whose only armor against the outside world is his knowledge of television? Pff, another silly cautionary tale about the excess of modern consumerism and mind-rotting television. I've seen it before.""</i>

I gave the film a letterboxd rating of 4 stars.

However, I found that as time went on the film continued to lurk in the back of my mind, and as I grew older, so too did my understanding of the film's socio-political underpinnings.

Although looking back, I suppose the line ""all you gotta be is white in America to get whatever you want,"" should've been a bit more of a dead-ringer.

Even past this more readily apparent layer of satire however, lies something even deeper and much less political. Within the story of Chauncey ""the"" Gardner lies a truth about all men and women from all walks of life.

That truth is as simple and unpretentious as anything presented in the film; that we are shadows. People walk about, day-to-day, convincing themselves of a world they think they know, and of the people who they believe they are.

Aristocratic men and women wander around luncheons and business conferences ruffling their feathers in tightly fitted suits, convincing themselves and others of their own importance. <b><i>Being There</i> </b>sees through this facade, and understands the inert banality which lies behind our daily performance. A persona which boils itself down to the singular platitudes.

""Hello.""
""Good day sir.""
""My day has been wonderful, how about yours?""
""The garden must wait until spring to flower.""

""Modern men,"" as T.S. Elliot once observed, ""are no more than stuffed shirts.""

No other movie could better exemplify this statement.

If <i><b>Being There</b></i> is classified as a fantasy, than the film has thoroughly proved its point.",,2017-05-28
2017-07-19,Amour,2012,https://boxd.it/iDZ3l,5,Yes,"I'd usually open my review with an overly-flowery analogy about the film at hand's thesis or philosophy; ontological priority... etc.

However, after watching <i>Amour</i>, banality seems to have beset me, and there's little to say other than precisely what I'm thinking.

<b><i>Amour </i></b>is about suffocation. It's about the age in which people stop wondering, or cavorting, or hoping. People find themselves trapped in the same chair everyday. Seated in front of the same cannabalising stereo system. Staring across the room at the same piano, from the same angle, every day. 

This treachery is soon supplanted however by death, and through <i>Amour</i>, death is what we see.

I see <i>death</i> everywhere in <i>Amour; </i>it takes on a stronger presence than even Bergman's vivid depiction in <i>The Seventh Seal.</i> It is ubiquitous. It is everywhere. It hides behind the curtains of Anne's bedroom, and the piano in Georges vacant music hall. It follows the characters right from the first scene, and I saw it every step of the way.

<i>Amour</i> is perhaps the greatest film of the decade, not because it breaks some sort of post-modern ground, but because it seems so sunken in just the opposite. It treads a minimalist style which the majority of filmmakers today seem to have either ignored or forgotten.

The movie itself is just as ancient as the characters; unable to move, stuck in the same chairs and classical music.

2017-08-26,"Synecdoche, New York",2008,https://boxd.it/jzOFz,5,Yes,"<b>I've avoided writing this review for a while now...</b>

Honestly, I feel a bit bad about it at this point. I just walked out of <i>Logan Lucky</i>, uplifted and hopeful, yet was once again nagged at the sight of a styrofoam gravestone laid out in preparation for the forthcoming Halloween season. Of course, how could anything else remind me?

<b><i>Synecdoche, New York</i></b> is a film... it stars Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

...hmm?

It's about...

...hmm?

There's no way to answer. This film is so much more than being <b>about</b> something. In fact, this is the rare film which transcends usage of the word <b>about</b> and becomes a movie which simply <b>is</b>.

It <b>is</b>...

What <b>is</b> it? How do I summarize the plot? 

What may be the greatest attribute of <b>Synecdoche </b>is that any attempt to recall the events of the film ends with something resembling poetry. 

Watching <b>Synecdoche</b> is less akin to viewing a movie than it is to reading the Mahabharata. It's a towering, edifying, unforgettable piece of work. Cliche usage of the word ""transcendent"" still can't even begin to describe the movie.

Where is this review going? Maybe the same place as the film, and perhaps as everybody reading this review; nowhere fast. 

Perhaps all that can really be said about <b>Synecdoche, New York</b> are the very words Roger Ebert immortalized in his aching four-star review in 2008...

<i>""There is no need to name the characters, name the actors, assign adjectives to their acting. Look at who is in this cast. You know what I think of them,"" - Ebert</i>

<b>Synecdoche, New York</b> simply can't be <i>reviewed</i>, it can only be decided.

Just try to hurry along and watch the film... before you can't.

And maybe also try to watch the movie while it's still relatively underground, because given 20, 30, maybe 40 years, this achievment might be regarded as being to film what Joyce’s “Ulysses” is to literature.

<i>Taxi Driver</i> is such a film.
<i>Solaris</i> is such a film.

<i><b>Vertigo</b> </i>is not such a film.
Or that is, it didn't seem to be.

The honest truth is that <i>Vertigo</i> did not genuinely make sense to me until I recalled the words and appraisals of David Fincher.

""What I love about <i>Veritgo</i> is that... it's just so perverted.""

or maybe when Francois Truffaut gave his two cents while speaking directly to Mr. Hitchcock.

""<i>Vertigo</i> is one of your most poetic films. It's more poetic than dramatic.""

This is the value of great writing on film. As these words and ideas pertaining to <i>Vertigo</i> penetrated my mind, bands of light ran through my head and the film did indeed <i>creep</i>, just as it should've.

I always like to presume myself as being ahead of films I watch. I'll step into a screening of <i>Annie Hall </i>or <i>A Clcokwork Orange </i>and think, ""well of course I'll love it, it's a masterpiece.""

<i>Vertigo</i> was a film I similarly suspected would immediately throw itself at the top of my ""Favorite Films"" list. Yet, the movie pulled one over on me, and Mr. Hitchcock indeed could've been snickering in the corner just as it had, because I was fooled.

The movie was ahead of me.

<i>Vertigo</i> initially confounded me more than entertained or provoked me. It's clash between old-Hollywood values and decidedly modern observations about sexual obsession, necrophilia, and perversion, were all a bit difficult to comprehend at once.

It seemed as though it would be so simple. Another Hitchcock film about a murder, a mystery, a whodunit. A love story, a detective story, a thrill ride with elegant production values and enormous wit. These attributes summarize all of Hitchcock's greatest works; <i>Psycho</i>, <i>Rear Window</i>, <i>North by Northwest</i>, <i>Shadow of a Doubt</i>, etc.

However, they do not describe <i><b>Vertigo</b></i>.

Hitchcock curtails his typical formula with such knowing precision that it's difficult not to view the man in a greater light than previously thought post-<i>Vertigo</i>. Francois Truffaut's praise of the director is in no way faint or ill conceived.

Film may have been a sideshow carnival attraction at the start of Hitchcock's life, but by the end of it, he personally had changed that stigma, and <i>Vertigo</i> maybe his greatest contribution to that revelation.","alfred hitchcock, masterpiece, 70mm, cinerama, jimmy stewart",2017-09-06
2017-10-24,Lucky,2017,https://boxd.it/l4ONJ,4.5,,"It's a platitude at this point to refer to anything as a ""<i>Swan Song</i>."" However, <i>Lucky</i> it seems is begging to be called one.

But never fear, because I have a thematic alternative...

<i><b>Lucky</b></i> is a kick, a stroke, a last breathe from a fading chanteuse. Harry Dean Stanton is a man whose face was destined to be etched in stone, seeing as perhaps it was already carved from stone.

All of this is foreskin though; observing the legacy of this legendary icon of cinematic triumph is not entirely the goal nor the purpose of his last film, and should not supplant proper judgement of the final product.

With that said, I'm glad to report that <i>Lucky</i> is just.. well, it's wonderful.

Never mind that the title is a bit oblique, or that the cast seems made up of retired supporting players from ""<i>T.J. Hooker"" or ""St. Elsewhere,</i> this is all part of the film's indelible charm. What's perhaps most appealing about <i>Lucky</i> though is that it plays not only as an homage to the immortal Stanton, but as a celebration of the art of character acting as well; a dignified Hollywood position as old as the industry itself.

Ed Begley Jr, James Darren, Beth Grant; these are all names most likely unfamiliar with audiences, but they each belong to a person whose face may just be strikingly familiar indeed, because you see, ""they were in that one movie, and I can't remember their name, but they were really good.""

<i>Lucky</i> is unabashedly devoted to this art of underdog celebrity, and it's tenderness is evident in almost every frame.

None of my praise thus far has even began to discuss the wonderful meditation on mortality, war-time reflection, small bars, cafes and fiestas that <i>Lucky</i> casually but resolutely explores; that's perhaps the mark of a great film, when you walk out humming of more than what happens directly throughout. The plot, dialogue and events hardly matter more than the tone and wisdom which magically arises from the film like warm steam.

If I were to recall, I would say there are three moments which stand out to me most.

<b>The first</b>; Harry Dean's heart-wrenching Hispanic ballad.

<b>The second</b>; co-star David Lynch (in an absolutely beautiful ode to his old friend) gives a spellbinding speech about the power of a tortoise. This is nearly as unforgettable a moment as the great director could create standing behind the camera rather than in front.

<b>The third</b> moment is perhaps the most important in the entire film. It's when Lucky, having come to terms with the inevitability of his own decay, saunters out into an empty plain, and stares up at a gigantic cacti. He likely realizes that the cacti had been there long before he was born, and that it would remain after he died. Lucky then smiles, looks away from the cacti, and toward the camera. 

Upon this simple moment, a pulse of warmth traveled through every member of the audience. In that moment, the real Harry Dean emerged, and he was smiling.

When a face carved of stone can manage, at the end of a life, to muster that smile, than something very much has gone right.

What has gone right you may ask? <i>Lucky;</i> the film itself, the tribute to Harry Dean. 

But then so too has everything about Harry Dean Stanton's life and career gone right, indisputably so. His personage has become more than that of a character actor, but of an everlasting monument to an era long-gone.

So goodbye <i>Paris, Texas</i>, goodbye <i>Repo Man.</i> Goodbye <i>Alien</i>, and <i>Pretty in Pink</i>, <i>Red Dawn</i>, and <i>Cool Hand Luke.    </i>

The soul of your films has passed on, and his name was <i>Harry Dean Stanton.</i>

Yet he'll continue to live on, perhaps for longer than any of us could hope for; only in the movies though...

Truthfully, I don’t know.

Upon watching this film on its initial theatrical release, I felt little for it. It was a movie which desired much too much to be called <i>cute,</i> yet ultimately wanted to make a quietly wistful statement about a young adult’s coming-of-age without really seeming to have the consequence to do so.

Four years pass; why can’t I shake this film yet? I’ve seen so many like it, yet this one, unlike many of the others, has hit the wall, managed to stick, and proceeded to run forever through the back-lit caverns of my mind for four damn years. 

I’ve wondered and wondered about what irresistible property this film possesses, yet come up with nothing but platitudes.

<b>“It’s charming,”</b> is a classic. Or perhaps the good old <b>“it’s tender and sincere,”</b> that was always the most earnest disposition.

However, I think I’ve finally resolved as to why the film is special beyond the words of most atypical praise.

Admirers claim the film to be sharp, insightful; it takes inspiration from the best Woody Allen and French New Wave films, and tells a story which many can relate to. However, the film’s great virtue lies not in it’s relatability to the audience and their lives, but in it’s relatability to their pasts.

Much like films such as <i>Annie Hall</i> and <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i>, <i>Frances Ha</i> is entrenched in a memory. 

It almost seems as though the first half of the film has been told about the last half, affecting the storytelling and reminding itself of the good times over the bad, of the innocent laughs which would come before the harsh storms, and of moments so tender and wonderful that they can only be recalled in glamorous montage.

Akin to classical literature, Frances Ha tells a story of humor on its surface, yet guilelessly flows just above a river of remembrance, of sadness, of a desire to be young. It’s a film about youth which makes it’s audience feel old.

Much like memory itself, Frances Ha accumulates over time, and grows sadder but more gratifying upon reflection. 

I was conned upon first viewing, just as Captain Ahab had been when the wind went out of sail. I was conned not by the film but by myself. In my attempts to over-intellectualize all aspects of being, I had actually been starved of confronting life’s unabashed messiness.

<i>Frances Ha</i> embraces this messiness in a way that is so endearing it’s almost insulting. 

Or maybe uplifting... I can’t be sure.",better than you think,2017-11-02
2017-11-25,Stalker,1979,https://boxd.it/lTLKp,5,,"I'm tired of being the dissenting voice in the room. Tarkovsky has something, and I was wrong.

There... I said it.

Solaris had bored me to tears... I thought it brilliant, but it bored me to tears. <b>Stalker<b> however, is an altogether different beast.

I watched the 1979 classic about a month or so ago (this review is written as of November 25th), yet I hadn't realized it's greatness until... just now. I tried to recall a recent dream, and nearly mistook it for my memory of Stalker. I had remembered the film as a dream.

Stalker has made more sense since this revelation, especially in regards to my opinion of Andrei Tarkovsky. Prior to watching Stalker, I felt dread. I was in fear of having to sit down for nearly three hours and watch something which I know will not only be cerebral or slow-paced, but actively, aggressively boring.

And yes, Stalker is boring. It is very boring; <i>but it works<i>.

The film takes on the form of a fairy tale, and remains as resonant as any Grimm Brothers storyline you've ever read. It's premise is simple. It's characters are unnamed. The plot seems non-existent, or too abstract to be interpreted on a first, second, or even third viewing. Yet the film is powerful.

A hugeness is felt as one watches Stalker, a sense of towering importance which all great works of art demand for themselves. Painfully slow as the film maybe, it forces your hand and you watch uncontrollably.

But let's come back to earth for just a moment and ask a question whom anybody praising Stalker is primed to ask: what is it about? The better question to ask would be if it matters, and if it shouldn't be gratifying enough that the film inspires such a question to be pronounced with genuine intent.

The general mystery of what Stalker actually <i>is<i> might simultaneously be the most exciting and haunting question to be asked in world cinema. We see the story of three individuals going into a place called ""The Zone"" in search of a room which grants wishes. Yet through it's three hour running time, Stalker seems to be so much more than this simple premise, and also so much less.

Most of Stalker is simply a distraction, or a daydream. We take so much time to follow a character across a short trail of grass, a small tunnel, an underground water reclamation facility. It seems that these sequences should've been boring, that my eyelids should have been baggy and ugly just as they were through Solaris, yet they remained as wet and alive as ever. 

I sat in awe of this emptiness, of the baffling scene lengths, of the didactic nature of travelling from point A to point B. Stalker is a film which is so slow, so methodical, that it pulls you into the world it inhabits with the quietest grip I think possible. I felt as though these characters; the writer, the professor, the stalker, were all dwarfs marching on the back of some great biblical serpent, whose body itself had become the Garden of Eden, and from whom escape was impossible.

How can such a feeling of dread enrapture the viewer? Even through a scene as seemingly innocent as the writer crossing a garden, I was sure that the man could've taken three steps to the right, veered off too far from the trail laid out by ""The Zone,"" and then disappeared into the ether. I waited the entire film for someone to make a wrong step in ""The Zone,"" for that someone to end up like a small crumpled origami, or flattened plate of dough, and yet no one ever seemed to.

Was there ever really any danger at all in the zone? Was the Stalker fed lies all these years by Porcupine? Would the room have really done anything at all? 

These questions are what feeds the lasting flame that is <b>Stalker<b>, they're what keeps the film young for a generation of moviegoers still eager for an experience unlike any other, and they're what will allow the film to live forever.

They're also the questions which keep me up at night, and which won't let go of me as I drift off into sleep and mistake my dreams for visions of ""The Zone"" and vice versa. 

Stalker is one of the few films which you will actually have to live with after you've seen it. The question is whether or not it's worth the trouble.","tarkovsky, avant-garde, psychological, fantasy, drama",2017-10-15

2017-12-18,It's Such a Beautiful Day,2012,https://boxd.it/mzEOD,5,Yes,"I'm not quite sure if there is any way to review <i>It's Such a Beautiful Day</i> without at least a fragmented acknowledgment of it's oft-cited pretension. Defining this pretension however, is what makes Don Hertzfeldt's film one of the most important and explosive in recent memory.

A movie composed of vignetted stick-figure drawings, <i>It's Such a Beautiful Day</i> dares an audience to accept it's style within two minutes of starting; it quickly bounds too far toward existential whoa for there to be any evaluative time beyond that. It also dares its audience to accept, if only for 62 minutes of runtime, that the foremost necessity of being is the being itself, and that this ephemeral being is worth distracting ourselves from the business of everyday life to observe with a microscope.

Is this pretentious?

No, it is not.

Don Hertzfeldt means every word and every frame of animation (having drawn each one frame-by-frame, with no digital or computer aid, you'd better damn-well hope that he means each frame). There is no filler, and there is no pretense. Everything the film presents us is true, and if it is not, than at least it is to Hertzfeldt. If not Hertzfeldt, than at least to Bill.

As far as I maybe concerned, young and admittedly inexperienced as I am, I can say with firm certainty that <i>It's Such a Beautiful Day</i> is truer to the everyday emotion and ventilation of my life than any other movie I've ever seen. No movie reaches into me and digs out as many evergreen roots as this. I am emptied by this movie.

Don Hertzfeldt is the single most important voice in cinema today, and his is a voice not heard quite enough. One needs to look no further than his last two films (<i>World of Tomorrow</i> and <i>It's Such a Beautiful Day</i>) to find this truth of life from which we distract ourselves suddenly staring us in the face with no reprieve. Ironic is the fact that this truth, as unpretentious as it is, amounts to key's clapping against a granite counter-top, to staplers in the office being piled atop each other, or to disillusioned preferences in the supermarket pertaining to how we choose produce.

<i>It's Such a Beautiful Day</i> leads it's audience to a place deep and unknowable, and suffocates them. It is near-impossible to lift a finger or even a toe-nail by the film's end. It's the sort of carnal reaction reserved for only a great revelation.

I hope I've not made the movie out to sound like an initiation into a cult, because if I have, than the greatest mistake I could make would be to write further and potentially deter you greater. It's simple; watch the film. There is no greater recommendation I can give. If you love it; excellent. If you hate it; at least you've watched it.","psychological, masterpiece, avant-garde, surreal, dark comedy",2017-12-15
2017-12-18,After Hours,1985,https://boxd.it/mzJ7f,5,Yes,"If ever there were a film to replace the word ""refrigerator"" in the punchline to the famous ""is it running?"" joke, than it would be this film.

<i>After Hours</i> can't stop. It cannot stop. It <b>refuses</b> to stop. Never has a film so stubbornly set it's foot down by running frantically with it.

Such are the joys of Martin Scorsese's <i>After Hours</i>, a far too often overlooked masterpiece from that so often lost period of the famous New York-director's career; the mid-80s. Yet it seems this lacking of notoriety has helped the film somewhat, that it's allowed the movie to flourish in relative obscurity if only because the knowledge of its brilliance is so exclusive, as is the recognition of it's influence.

From the cavernous presentation of New York's Soho district via Michael Ballhaus's cinematography, to the should-be iconic synthesizer score by Howard Shore, <i>After Hours'</i> inspiration is superlative, and it's originality has influenced countless contemporary urban films; this past year's <i>Good Time</i> felt so close in structure and atmosphere to the movie that I found it nearly to be a remake.

But <i>After Hours</i> remains alone, sitting in a class of it's own alongside the greatest works of Hitchcock and Bresson when viewed in context as a film whose sole purpose is to viscerally effect an audience. To build them up, to shake them, to excite them, and to present a roller coaster as exciting and visceral as the most recent Star Wars film.

Griffin Dunne is perhaps the most likable and relatable of all Scorsese protagonists, presenting us with a level-headed yuppie who wants nothing more than to have a good time with a mysterious woman he meets in the lower east-side of Manhattan. When this opportunity turns sour from too many interlopers and disturbing ""surrender Dorothy"" anecdotes (which I will not divulge to you now for fear of spoiling the surprise), the film changes direction.

What is so damn fun about <i>After Hours</i> is how this change in direction is only the first in what ends up becoming dozens of asides and developments, each one delighting and terrifying even more than the last.

Somehow the film manages a tricky balance between genuine peril and merciless screwball charm, of threatening mobs and hapless Cheech and Chong antics, all built on the foundation of Scorsese's typically hostile and neurotic depiction of life in the confusing concrete jungle of New York City. It's a combination of elements which could only be so perfectly balanced when helmed by a director of unending cinematic invention and mastery of tone.

That the movie doesn't come apart at it's seams, and remains a distinctive and wholesome chase of a film right up until the last frame, is a testament to the brilliance of Scorsese's direction. You may try to chase this film, but you won't be able to keep up with it.

<i>After Hours</i> works hard to complete itself. It struggles against every frame and every confusing or delusional plot development, and it's one of the most engaging and exciting films of it's type ever to be made because of it.","masterpiece, better than you think, martin scorsese",2017-12-17

2017-12-23,Twin Peaks: The Return,2017,https://boxd.it/mIQ59,5,Yes,"There have been many films and many television shows which attempt to tell a story.

Characters are placed in a familiar environment, and affect for one another in a generally coherent way which induces tension, laughter, fear.

Only <i>David Lynch</i> has the audacity to do what's been done. The film (not television show) which graced my eyes tonight and concluded with a curtain call unlike any other I've beheld, was not like these other films and television shows.

Instead, a series which began with the vivid cries of ""she's dead!"" inevitably found it's end with a question; ""what year is this?""

<i>""What year is this?""</i>

""Twin Peaks"" is a cultural institution as of 2017. It's 1990 pilot was one of the major events of television history, garnering the attention of 34.6 million televisions, and countless more subsequent generations not yet born or even conceived.

Isn't it simply brilliant then, that the series should end 25 years later with two of the show's most iconic characters sitting side by side in a car, riding along an empty night road, alone. Two characters who may be neither who the audience believes they are, nor who they say they are; both riding on from an unseemly Texas slum into the iconic yet now unknowable Twin Peaks. These moments are perhaps the most important and unbearably poignant of the entire series, yet undeniably the most singularly confounding.

By the end of ""Twin Peaks,"" the audience may try to grasp at a sensible narrative about alternate dimensions and time-travel, but their hands will close on thin air.

Many will try their best, then try, try, and try again to explain away the many baffling mysteries and subconscious delusional loops of <i>""Twin Peaks: The Return.""</i> Many more will simply shove aside the series as pretentious, nonsensical tripe. Only a select few I suspect, will manage to phase through the barriers of narrative and storytelling to realize the brilliance of Lynch's accomplishment.

There is no story. There are no characters. There is only the presentation, and what the audience chooses to believe. David Lynch has taken his own seminal work of television and willingly morphed it into the greatest dadaist work of art to ever broadcast over television airwaves. His accomplishment is stunning, gob-smacking, and magnificent.

<i>""The Return""</i> has been filled with unforgettable moments of the unexplained, even entire episodes dedicated to pure mystery (episode 8 anybody?). However, the series as a whole, with all of its dangling threats of straight-forward narrative, ultimately proved itself in the finale to be the greatest single testament to the unknown ever created.

Honestly, not much can really be said of <i>""Twin Peaks: The Return,""</i> and assigning it a star rating, letter grade, or numerical value out of 10, simply seems futile.

It is what it is, and exists in a world where characters can't be and stories are not told. It is mystery. It is confusion. It is madness incarnate.

It is whatever ""pure cinema"" must be. It is David Lynch.

2017-12-26,Phantom Thread,2017,https://boxd.it/mPb3P,5,,"<b>Watched at Arclight Hollywood - 70mm Film Presentation</b>

<i>""I simply do not have time for confrontation...""</i>

I think Paul Thomas Anderson admires Reynolds Woodcock more than he lets on. Here is a man whose films are so taught and lovingly nuanced that they may as well be crafted by hand; sewn with the precision of a dressmaker pulling together his masterwork, and directed with the firm hand of a man unbounded by marriage or humanist commitments.

<i>Phantom Thread</i> is Anderson's most narratively linear yet pointedly opaque work since <i>The Master</i>, and is possibly his most finely crafted exercise in tone. The film presents us with a world defined by lonely Gothic interiors, and equally lonely people trapped within them.

Humans are an animal, but in Anderson's world have been diluted to the utility of a roman column. People are not people, but vague beacons of supposed beauty with deeply housed insecurities and dissatisfactions. PTA elucidates this bleak thematic permanence with multiple prodigiously managed filmic elements; photography, sound, locations, and most abundantly - performance.

No actor can affect as quietly as Day-Lewis. He talks and moves and walks, yet how he speaks or moves and walks hardly matters. One gets the sense of a character from Day-Lewis emanating not from visible nuances, but from a general aura of being. Something deep within him seems to know who he is and does not need to kid; that man is real. His performance requires no excessive make-up or histrionic accent, yet the indisputable fact of this fictional character's reality is real; real as long as he lives in Day-Lewis. The performance is a marvel to behold.

As pervasive yet even more thoroughly inscrutable than Day-Lewis' Woodcock are his costars Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville as love-interest Alma and sister Cyril. All three characters form a trio of constantly evolving power dynamics, whose turbulence in manner and function is what gives <i>Phantom Thread</i> it's shape and intrigue. What it noticeably does not provide the film with however, is a point or perhaps even a purpose.

Running through my head constantly during the film was a simple question; ""what is the nature of this relationship which I am apparently being presented?"" Paul Thomas Anderson has described his film as a Romance. After watching his film, I find this statement to be so blatantly inaccurate that I can presume it only be either a joke or a rosy-cheeked lie.

At least, that is what I initially suspected. It took only a few hours of mulling to realize the fundamental stupidity of my assumption. Of course this romance is no joke; the relationship of the film <b>being</b> a romance is the point of the film. It is a relationship of constant betrayal, of one partner pushing the other nearly to a threshold of death, only to retort with a hug and a smile. This is romance; this is love.

The story is set ambiguously in post-WWII London, yet it's scathing interpretation of human relations could belong anywhere. Unlike Anderson's other movies, <i>Phantom Thread</i> represents an era not in abstract social ideologies, but in searing universal emotion.

A film which I have no good reason to compare <i>Phantom Thread</i> with yet readily will is oddly enough another widely acclaimed Drama from earlier this year; <i>The Florida Project</i>. Both movies ultimately seem to be about how we define love, using class and contemporary gender politics to explore that infinitely complex question.

However, whereas <i>The Florida Project</i> paints a vivid picture of life on the outskirts of ""lower"" civilization with characters who are completely feckless byproducts of a confusing and byzantine world which couldn't care less for their existence, <i>Phantom Thread</i> shows us the opposite. People who are suffocated by their apparent stature, by the expectation to be stoic and coiled, and who never are able to say or speak what they truly think. As troubled as the characters in <i>Florida Project</i> seemed to be, they at least could shout and scream and do almost anything they wanted without much consequence. The same cannot be said of Woodcock and his doomed house of jousting fashion designers.

Even more powerful than the film's emotion however, is it's look. PTA, much like Woodcock, was so set on toiling away with his most recent project that he spent 9 months languishing in pre-production, testing and retesting alternatives to shooting his film, effectively taking on all cinematographic duties and shaping the look of his film to a necessarily lorded-over tee.

<i>Phantom Thread</i> looks unbelievably beautiful in a used vinyl record sort of way. Anderson apparently echoed throughout production a desire to be unconventionally dirty, and to avoid overt glorification of royal history; <i>""Whatever you do, don't make it look like The Crown.""</i> This odd and specific request is I think an insight into the quiet genius of his craft.

Anderson is ultimately not so much a filmmaker as he is an author of sociology, trying to explain in a didactic way the folly of human ideologues and pretenses, and <i>Phantom Thread</i> maybe his most effectively ardent stance on the self-destructive tendencies of all human behavior.

What is so stunning about his achievement in communication this time around is that he manages to convey as much as he does with so little. Dialogue is often an underserved aspect of contemporary arthouse cinema, yet Anderson makes his words nearly as important as his visuals. Dialogue is handled through <i>Phantom Thread</i> in much the same way three-dimensional space is handled through <i>Stalker</i>; it is sparse and particular, exacting when it needs to be yet mostly uncertain.

Ultimately, I've come away from <i>Phantom Thread</i> with the same question I've come away from most PTA films with; ""what the hell was that about?"" Yet unlike <i>The Master</i> and <i>Inherent Vice</i>, that question's answer does seem within reach. How do I know? Well, Woodcock tells us.

<i>""You can sew almost anything into the canvas of a coat.""</i> Anderson has done much the same thing; he has hidden a message within the linings of the garments, and it is our job to tear apart the dress and find it.","masterpiece, 70mm, drama, meta-commentery, reality",2017-12-25

2018-01-15,Where the Wild Things Are,2009,https://boxd.it/nH4FF,5,Yes,"Whenever I watch <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>, I'm reminded of a quote by Charlie Kaufman which I love and admire.

<i>""Dreams are our most intimate dialogue with ourselves.""</i>

Understanding this quote is the key to understanding Spike Jonze's masterpiece. The world he creates is not one ruled by logic--large forests give way to dunes of sand, monstrous creatures behave like neurotic adult children, and sleeping in a pile or building a fort is the surest way to peace and happiness--but the world operates on an emotional truth recognizable to most children.

Jonze's film is a more primal and vivid depiction of childhood than perhaps any other apparent ""children's film"" I've ever seen, or hardly ANY film I've seen for that matter. Even <i>The 400 Blows</i> doesn't seem as true a film about childhood to me.

Spike Jonze is a filmmaker as audacious as Truffaut to be sure, but his portrayal of adolescent alienation stings particularly of middle-american ideals gone wrong, more so than Truffaut's which seems defined by a self taught listlessness informed by poverty and a hard-nosed adult populace. The world of Max is much less immediately hostile, yet belies a more passive-aggressive and fatalistic outlook, such as when his school teacher rings about the sun's death.

<i>""Of course the sun won’t
always be here to keep us warm. It,
like all things, will die...""</i>

When I was in the 2nd grade, I would become frantic about global warming. I'd caught glimpses of the Al Gore documentary <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> around the time of it's release, and I was shook to the core. All day and night, I'd think about the tides receding and pulling, and wading closer to the porch of my house with each influx. I'd lay in bed and worry. <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> understands that worry.

I don't know what Spike Jonze is doing over at Viceland right now, but whatever it is and however much Jonze is able to make from his high-management occupation, it's value couldn't possibly be greater than that of his best films. No director working today is as deservedly earnest as Jonze. Even such fantastic contemporary filmmakers such as Paul Thomas Anderson and David Fincher seem to have a cynicism undercutting their work which I find moderately unappealing, and lack the sincerity of Jonze's narrative engineering.

<i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> stands alongside <i>Her</i> as a singular achievement by Jonze in producing totally unpretentious truth from an almost juvenile, childlike sensibility. I don't even know how to explain it really, but I just find myself moved nearly to tears by this film every time I've watched it since release.

Perhaps it is just that truth about childhood which reflects upon what I was going through when I'd first seen the movie on release in 2009; that aching uncertainty about being a human and living a humdrum existence, totally befuddled by the notion of responsibility and maturity.

<i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> doesn’t remember childhood as a warm memory of opening Millennium Falcon and Hulk action figures under the Christmas tree, but as a haven for lost years of irrevocable mistakes and irretrievable ambitions, of feeling that the world is going to end everyday only to wake up the next morning with the same concurrent fear the night before.

<i>""Carol? Did you know the sun was
gonna die?""</i>

<i>""Oh come on. That can’t happen.
You’re the king. And look at me,
I’m big. How could guys like us
worry about a tiny little thing
like the sun?""</i>","spike jonze, better than you think",2018-01-14
2018-01-17,Her,2013,https://boxd.it/nLKW7,5,Yes,"<i>Her</i> is my closest friend; a film ruled not by moving images, but by an intimate relationship between itself and it's audience that in fact two human beings who live and love together manage through the overtures and undulations of their daily lives. Film maybe a visual medium, but <i>Her</i> is more concerned with being aural, visceral, sensual.

Jonze doesn't even seem to try conveying anything explicitly profound, he simply does so by happenstance. His contemporaries (master craftsmen such as David Fincher or PTA) may strain and heave with their directing to pursue a thematically fascinating subject matter, but Jonze does something simpler and altogether more demure. Before directing a story about an era, he writes a story about two people; two humans... Ironic that in this case one of them is a computer.

In actuality, I find it funny how underserved humanity is in contemporary cinema in general. Indeed, it seems that our most lauded contemporary filmmakers have all but abandoned the human. The human is a thing of shame, a fragile and saccharine thing feared by filmmakers and forced to sit in the corner with a dunce cap.

<i>""We don't want you,""</i> they say, <i>""the 21st century is too difficult a sociopolitical time for the human.""</i>

In several of my most recent movie reviews, I've made a great deal of argument in favor of sincerity. I've felt overwhelmed through the past decade by a population of ""prestige"" films which neglect the saccharine or the human. It seems easy to create a work of art which distances itself from the complex and often manipulative nature of emotion in favor of a more intellectual presentation of thematic elements. Treading vulnerable ground in film is indeed dangerous. Nevertheless, masterpieces such as <i>Her</i> still relentlessly prove that cinema is our most primal art-form, and that Love is not an emotion to be ignored on the silver screen.

Everytime I watch <i>Her</i>, I smile and I smile and then I keep smiling because it's one of the few films which is able to force my guard down, and to engage me in more than an intellectual exercise.

Maybe it's because sometimes confronting emotion is good. Sometimes it's important to be pulled on a slip n' slide, and to not question it's wetness. Sometimes it's healthy to confront life in all of it's machinated rages of confusion and loneliness and sadness. Sometimes it's good to be a human.","masterpiece, spike jonze, drama, psychological",2018-01-17
2018-01-27,F for Fake,1973,https://boxd.it/o7kMz,4,,"Probably the best edited film ever made, <i>F for Fake</i> is baffling and charming, frustrating and haunting all at once. It maybe Orson Welles' most personal film.

I have little idea how to describe the movie, other than to say that it's an extended video essay about fraud which ultimately is a meta-commentary on itself. The rate at which Welles delivers information is rapid and gobsmacking; as with <i>Citizen Kane</i> before it, Orson Welles again proves himself to be ahead of his time by at least two decades.

I'd likely adore <i>F for Fake</i> if it weren't for the unfettered truth I must admit to, which is that I understood little of the film as it was happening, and denounced most of it before it had finished. Welles essentially dares his audience to discount what they're seeing and what they're being told, and in 2018 I do find it all too easy to disbelieve the visual information I'm delivered, so unfortunately what was a novel concept in 1973 has devolved into a depressing inevitability. 

It also doesn’t help that <i>F for Fake</i> is so eager to invalidate itself that I have trouble even acknowledging it as a film of any substance. The substance is in it's lack of substance.

<i>F for Fake</i> may be the smartest movie ever made in concept, execution, and delivery. However, that doesn't mean it's really much fun to watch or that we should believe in not believing it any more than we would like to believe it (in not believing I mean). The movie’s too obtuse to allow for anything other than cynical disbelief, and my issue is taken in that sometimes I DO like to believe in something, even if it's a lie. Lies are more comforting than people like to admit, and sometimes being fooled is all that a person can ever want or need. Perhaps then Elmyr is right.

<i>""I am not the faker. The experts who look at my paintings - they’re the fakers.”</i>

Maybe Orson Welles isn't the fraud. Maybe I am, just for seeking truth in Art. Or maybe this entire film is fraud, even it's wagging finger at fraud, or maybe all of cinema is fraud, or something. Who really knows I guess.","meta-commentery, reality, surreal, drama",2018-01-26

- Pauline Kael

That's the question which all <i>serious</i> cinema must tender. How far can the filmmaker push before driving their audience to either shrieking bouts of laughter or plagues of madness? In the case of <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i>, Left Bank director Alan Resnais seems to not care weather his audience is interested in Frederiksbad, or Marienbad, or Baden-Salsa. He only cares that they wonder.

While I sat watching <i>Marienbad,</i> I wondered how any production crew, cast of actors, or hired screenwriters would contribute their efforts to a film so ethereal. What did the extras cast as vapid socialites inhabiting Marienbad's corridors have to gain from production? Did they understand the film they were in? Did they find it strange to be asked by their director to sit or stand frozen after repeating dialogue which seems gleamed from furniture catalogues and banal New Yorker editorials? Were they even told their characters existed in time?

Curioser and curioser as I found these questions to become, I eventually relented and realized the atrophy of my own efforts. If there was a point to be found in <i>Last Year at Marienbad,</i> it was that my only satisfaction to be gleamed from the film was self-made, and in fact, nonexistent.

<i>Marienbad</i> is a film not made for any complex or malevolent purpose. I believe Resnais when he says it was his attempt to ""visualize the complexity of thought."" Nevertheless the frustration incited by <i>Marienbad</i> is palpable, mostly because the movie exists so strongly and presents itself so earnestly, yet astutely refuses coherence.

Why then, with all that has been said, have I awarded <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> 5 Stars? Unlike the film itself, an explanation is easy: because I like to be frustrated. Righteous ambiguity is a currency little found in modern avant-garde imitations of <i>Marienbad</i>. A filmmaker like Gaspar Noe can only dream of creating a balance between mystery and romance as magnetic as that of <i>Marienbad</i>.

I don't care whether she was at Marienbad last year with him... or Fredericksbad, or Baden-Salsa. I do however, care whether or not Resnais asks one of his extras to move without question, or whether his lead actress will turn toward a corridor in one shot to find herself in the subsequent shot staring toward another.

As the 2010s have pressed on, I've wondered how cinema can survive in a contemporary culture defined by visual hyperbole. It's terrifying to think that eventually all there will be is ukulele bits of film scattered about the popular consciousness, bereft of purpose, intelligence, or totality. Everything will exist in its most immediate form.

I'm uncertain as to whether this future is one to look forward to or to fear completely. However, in a time when ""movies"" scarcely seem to exist and ""film"" can barely be seen projected, a work such as <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> stands as testament to the proscenium of classic cinema. An ode to a time in which movies existed only as a performance wrung off celluloid and projected onto a screen.

When watching <i>Last Year at Marienbad,</i> one is struck with the unequivocal feeling that what they're seeing is a movie. Not a commodity, or product, YouTube clip or ukulele bit, but a FILM, whose strength rides on each shot running into the next as fluidly as the words of a hyper-textual novel.

2018-03-19,All That Jazz,1979,https://boxd.it/q2uMd,5,Yes,"<b>Watched on Criterion Collection Blu-Ray - Sourced from 4K Remaster of Original Camera Negative</b>

In spite of all its crass theatrics, <i>All That Jazz</i> is indisputably an Art-house film. Bob Fosse is not a conniving marketing schematic, he is a ranting madman for whom restraint has long been a stranger. Fosse is a man surviving solely on Dextroamphetamines both on-screen and off, and his evident artistic abandon is what makes <i>All That Jazz</i> totally insane, fascinating, weird, and altogether unlike any other movie musical the cinema has seen.

The movie teases banality; it tricks the audience into suspecting melodrama.

<i>""Gasp!""</i> an audience member might think, <i>""Is Joe Gideon's (Roy Scheider's) character ever going to transcend infidelity?""</i>

The answer never comes, or if it does, it does so only in passing. Why? Because the movie doesn't really care for this melodrama. The movie fools its audience into believing one falsity: that this film is about the personal tribulations of a theatre director. In reality, its about something narrower; his death.

<i>""Huh?""</i> an audience member will think. <i>""That's not very musical at all!""</i> another may say.

Ah, but musical Fosse makes it nonetheless. The director envisions Joe Gideon's death as a triptych of show-tunes tailored to the character, as a Kubler-Ross checklist of emotions, as a massive television finale broadcast in sequined shades of gold and purple. What sort of movie musical is this? A fucked-up one I suppose, but one whose shocking commitment to the macabre has to be admirable.

Bob Fosse is perhaps the unsung genius of American cinema. With only three films (<i>Cabaret</i>, <i>Lenny</i>, and <i>All That Jazz</i>) he normalized the economy of avant-garde European cinema among mainstream audiences, and did so in a way so bereft of pretense that some audiences not paying attention even excused the films as vulgar showmanship. Meek homage to broadway and old hollywood. Yet to hurl such criticisms in <i>All That Jazz</i>'s direction would be to miss the point entirely.

Like other great American directors such as Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch, Fosse uses tropes of old hollywood to disillusion his audience, to convince them of one overriding emotion while another boils underneath. We may SEE a golden-sequined jacket running down Joe Gideon's back, yet the reality beneath this veneer is staring us in the face; he's dead. He IS dead, and none of this vulgar display will save him.

It may indeed be that, as Irving Berlin wrote, <i>""there's no people like show people, they smile even when they are low,""</i> but should that really be considered a virtue?

Bob Fosse's films aren't about celebrating show business, they're about condemning it. They peel away layer-by-layer each duplicitous facet of the industry until all that remains is a man being zipped into a body-bag.

You can pretend for as long as you want; you can fake it until you make it. But still, there's always one person you can never fool, who'll always be waiting for you at the end of the curtain call. 

No matter how loudly the audience cheers, the applause will fade, and all that will be left is the one who you could never fool: death.

Bresson captures himself on-camera in the most circuitous, wondrous way, portraying a man who crafts his escape with the same skill that Bresson has crafted his narrative.

Anybody who intends to make a film of any sort must see this first. It is one of the sacred gospels of the cinema. Ask Christopher Nolan, ask David Fincher; it stands as one of the great testaments to motion, to structure, to subjectivity in movies.

To watch Bresson's craft at work is to stand in awe of cinema at it's most fundamental. One can see in his movies the development of a film grammar, one that has become so embroiled in the contemporary craft that to regard his filmography is to regard the very origin of an entire genre.

2018-04-10,Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,1971,https://boxd.it/qRlFf,5,Yes,"This movie always seems like its about to fall apart, yet it never does. A production which was made on the fringes of Hollywood and produced by the goddamned Quaker Oats Company.

Why is it any good?

I really couldn't say. But <i>Will Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i> is one of those films that just feels like it was meant to last. One watches it not as a movie but as a storybook; it hardly matters whether the film's technically competent or elegant, it just matters that it inspires in a child genuine wonder. Real movie magic struck on screen for us to enjoy.

And what's the glue pulling this ramshackle affair together? What else... Gene Wilder. The man who could smile at a phone book and make you cry. His performance is one which embodies the central conflict of the film; cynicism versus innocence. He teases us with the notion of being a clinical capitalist, only to return with a hug and a whimper and an irrefutable goodness.

Wilder's imprint is what makes <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i> one of the great testaments to movie magic. Some doubt this theory of ""movie magic,"" seeming to think it hokum. But one needn't look any further than Wilder's <b><i>Pure Imagination</i></b> number to see indisputable proof. This thing which we call magic exists, and here it is on our screen. We mustn't ignore it.

Even through the poor production design, lousy film stock, paltry budget and occasionally bizarre repertory theatre acting, <i>Willy Wonka</i> shines as a favorite film of mine, one which I couldn't wait to watch again and again as a child, and one which I hope will age alongside me as a close friend.

2018-04-13,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,1982,https://boxd.it/qX2zJ,5,Yes,"I'd forgotten just how much of his score John Williams gives over to the harp in <i>E.T.</i> An instrument of pure, unadulterated wonder, perhaps in kinship with the film itself. Beaming and ephemeral.

<i>E.T. The Extra Terrestrial</i> is not a serious film. I don't take its plot seriously. It operates on a logic which I think Martin Scorsese would describe as ""spiritual realism,"" defined more by poetry than logic. <i>E.T.</i> is a fairy tale.

It's easy to wince at <i>E.T.</i> then I suppose. To avert your eyes to its unabashed sentimentality, but if one does so then the film has, funnily enough, proved its point.

E.T. himself is such an engaging creation because what makes him alien is not his technology or bio-physical being, but his childlike demeanor. His innocence is what separates him from both the (well-intentioned) doctors tending to his illness and the audience which rejects his film. E.T. is too good of a corporeal being, too peaceful of a life-form to congeal with his own audience. Elliot remains his only friend.

Of course one can laugh at E.T.'s facile image and posing with Ronald Reagan, but for all his funneling into popular culture, the character and his film still remain a stranger to all of its box office receipts. Take a step back, and look at the film itself. Even if one doesn't wish to praise <i>E.T.</i> for its sentimentality, then praise it for its ingenuity.

<i>E.T.</i> is an inspired film, and a bizarre film. Taking place mostly in one home, and entirely in one small neighborhood in Southern California. Most seem to overlook this fact. The film is small, almost intimate, yet is given the scope of an epic by Allen Daviau's brilliant cinematography, which recalls the likes of Gregg Toland in how deep its shadows and foggy its interiors remain throughout.

Through Daviau's cinematography, <i>E.T.</i> becomes about more than just an alien and the boy it befriends. It's about a house becoming the bridge between two worlds; the alien's and the human's, the innocent and the cynical. Not only are Daviau's interiors some of the most beautifully lit in cinema, but they are also, for me, brilliant Freudian metaphors. Just how big is Elliot's closet? How far do those shadows reach. Perhaps like Spielberg's own memories of childhood, Elliot's house is easy to get lost in.

Then of course there's John William's score, which is so goddamned perfect that I need not go into detail. It's a masterpiece in and of itself.

<i>E.T.</i> itself is, perhaps, Spielberg's most personal film. He reflects on his own childhood so obviously the movie nearly becomes an autobiography; a missing father, an alienated sibling, and an alien who takes on a preeminent, almost holy presence. Indeed any film concerning alien life is a religious one for Spielberg, one needn't look further than <i>Close Encounters</i> to see this spiritual dynamic unfolding. For him, <i>E.T.</i> is what <i>Last Temptation of Christ</i> was to Scorsese; a challenge of faith.

How can this film be anything other than poetry? It means so much to its director, it means so much to its audiences, and it means so much to me. There's nothing sentimental about it in that sense.

<i>E.T.</i> may not be this brilliantly constructed, intellectual thing, but it is nevertheless a beautiful thing. It's not meant to be logical; it's a work of cinema poetry.","masterpiece, better than you think",2018-04-12
2018-04-17,Last Year at Marienbad,1961,https://boxd.it/r7lDl,5,Yes,"<b>Watched on Criterion Blu-Ray</b>

After circuitous waves of reconsidering and evaluating, I can now safely say that <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> is one of the greatest films ever made.

As hard as Kubrick and Antonioni may have tried to change the film form through the 1960s, both directors are jests under a big top when stood alongside Alan Resnais's towering ice palace.

<i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> maybe nonsense, but if it is, than its brilliance lies in its use of the film form as a sideshow to distract from that fact. It doesn't need a plot; the film form and its perversion is the plot. ""Nonsense"" can't even enter the conversation because the very notion of ""nonsense"" implies an imminent safety net of logic to fall back upon, which <i>Marienbad</i> simply does not have.

To watch <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> is to be confronted with the worst kind of terror, the sort from which there is no escape because its been with us all along. The dawning realization that our lives have no reason, that logic has no place, that mathematics are as artificial a construction as the baroque interior of this chateau.

<i>Marienbad</i> presents us with a world more deprived of logic than even the hotel suite at the end of <i>2001</i>.

2018-05-04,Repulsion,1965,https://boxd.it/rH8lF,4,,"I’ll go on record by saying that I like this (A LOT) better than Rosemary's Baby, which I've always felt a stranger to.

I'm not sure whether <i>Repulsion</i> is quietly progressive or terrifically misogynist, but regardless of the gender-role implications in its pulp narrative, the film remains a quintessential psychological horror film.

No director other than Polanski seems more comfortable with portraying a notion of evil on-screen. What I most love about <i>Repulsion</i> is its challenge to the audience in deciding from where that evil descends; the men perhaps? The social obligation to fidelity?

I've seen few films more ready to embrace a sort of solipsistic psychopathic terror. Unlike <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, a film whose narrative seems to stumble lugubriously through its various plot developments, <i>Repulsion</i> is a feature-length distilling of Polanski's best talents.

Watching the dissolution of Catherine Deneuve's Carol (Deneuve is EXCELLENT as always) is a narrative in psychotic despair. It's the nightmare sequence from <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> stretched for an entire runtime. The plot hardly matters more than the story told in Polanski's camera moves, choice of lens; his way of delineating hallucination and reality with set construction or omission of audio.

<i>Repulsion</i> is, perhaps, a filmmaker's film. One which prioritizes the film form above narrative or character.

Rather, it's narrative becomes the atrophy of consciousness, and its lead character - Polanski himself... looking through a director's eyepiece and understanding precisely where to set the camera, when to edit, how to frame. My pleasure is derived from his evident ingenuity.

Troubling as Polanski's real life maybe, there's no doubt that every ounce of trauma he has endured and afflicted in equal measure is up there on the screen with each film he makes. Movies wouldn't be the same without his craft.

Perhaps cinema no longer needs Polanski. But, for better or worse, there was a time when it did.",roman polanski,2018-05-04
2018-05-09,The Pianist,2002,https://boxd.it/rRGEB,5,Yes,"<i>The Pianist</i> is the greatest and most important of Holocaust films, even more so than <i>Schindler's List</i>. While the latter film is, as Stanley Kubrick put it, ultimately ""about success,"" <i>The Pianist</i> is ultimately about failure.

Why does Wladyslaw survive? How? He could've died just as easily as any other. Was it divine will? Wit? Intelligence?-no it wasn't. He survived because he survived. During the failure of civilization that was the Holocaust, survival was as incidental as death.

One need-not praise Adrien Brody's performance anymore than it already has been. His way of encapsulating tragedy just with facial expression is almost kabuki in method yet staggering in execution. While it's lamentable that Brody's career ultimately veered toward mediocrity, his performance as Szpilman will always remain a heartbroken shrine to both his real-life counterpart and the millions of Polish Jews beside him.

The remaining merits of the film are barely relevant; it looks as it should, sounds as it should, moves as it should. What matters is its narrative implications and raw impact.

We see boxcars and pistols, but no concentration camps. Gunshots, but no gas chambers. A young boy is seen stretching for the Warsaw ghetto from under a dividing brick wall; he dies, and we see only one half of the struggle. What happened on the other side? We never see, but does it matter? The holocaust can't be observed in one image, it can't be understood with one line of dialogue; by showing us less, Polanski gives the sensation of such tragedy an unprecedented, tangible realism. He ties up nothing.

Just as pointless as Szpilman's survival is the boy's incidental death, and just as pointless as the boy's incidental death is the death of 6 million Jews. No other film has better understood the sheer relentless nonsense of such a catastrophic failure.

One can feel during <i>The Pianist</i> a certain resignation by Polanski. Spielberg said that making <i>Schindler's List</i> was the hardest experience of his life, yet Polanski, having himself suffered through Krakow and the Holocaust, must've quietly understood by the time he directed <i>Pianist</i> what horror truly was. Tangible, human horror. That quiet acceptance is felt throughout <i>The Pianist</i>.

<i>Son of Saul</i> is more skillfully directed, <i>Schindler's List</i> exists on an epic scope, yet Polanski's <i>Pianist</i> is simply the truest film about the Holocaust. It is the most real.

For the first 3rd of <i>Blindspotting</i>, I found myself sitting about two empty seats behind the director. Carlos Lopez Estrada was sunken into his seat, and I could only see the top half of his head. He reminded me of Steven Spielberg screening his first cut of <i>Close Encounters</i>; nervous, frightened, and hoping that his chair would cannibalize him and protect from the tight-lipped audience behind.

My sympathy goes out to every filmmaker whose ever sat in earnest for an audience to react to their film. For when you sit in that damp theater, waiting for a needle to drop, we are all that young Steven Spielberg; cowering under our seat, hoping for redemption through cinema.

Anyway, <i>Blindspotting</i> was quite good. It's storytelling sometimes wreaked of music-video sensibilities (a dream-sequence about half-way through the film feels like a totally misplaced MTV interlude), but overall its insights were, at best, original to me. The story of two friends... a white man who wants to be a black man, and a black man who sometimes wants to be a white man, is a fascinating little parable of its own accord.

The only downside is that films with this barefaced an approach to race relations have now, somehow depressingly, become a bit pedestrian among the art-house. Since the introduction of <i>Get Out</i> into our popular cinematic conscience, the effect of an undisguised race-related film has become nerfed.

Still, there's a lot to like about <i>Blindspotting</i>, and its exposé of Whites appropriating Black culture is particularly fascinating and insightful.",,2018-05-19

One of the most punishing of all Japanese films, <i>Sansho the Bailiff</i> is an almost impossible exercise in implied sadism. Slaves are branded, men are tortured, a woman's tendon is cut, and yet it all is most horrifying for occurring just outside the frame.

Much like <i>Come and See</i>, another film exploring the depths of human depravity, <i>Sansho</i> is one of the least glorified portrayals of violence I've ever bore witness to.

However, what's most disturbing and mournful about the narrative of <i>Sansho the Bailiff</i> is just how incidental the suffering of our main characters is.

How is it that an innocent family being broken apart for decades and irreparably sieged by the ravages of time and circumstance can be so... superfluous?

2018-05-29,The Sacrifice,1986,https://boxd.it/suraz,4.5,,"<b>Watched 4k Restoration at Grand Illusion Cinema</b>

It's always difficult to speak or write after a Tarkovsky film. Not because they're emotionally overwhelming, but because they're intellectually exhausting.

I've wrestled a great deal with this distance between me and the films of Andrei Tarkovsky, a distance which is evident in every film he ever made; this distance between audience and screen, between camera and subject, between narrative and theme. As Roger Ebert once wrote:

<i>""Tarkovsky refuses to reach out with narrative tricks in order to involve us. Some movies work their magic in the minds of the audience; these ones stay resolutely on the screen""</i>

It is ludicrous to write of Tarkovsky effusively yet ignore the preeminent fact of his films; that he refused to involve his audience. Instead, he required them to work for his films, rather than the other way around.

<i>The Sacrifice</i> is his film which most earns this dynamic. It is a movie unashamedly about faith, which is appropriate considering how much of it Tarkovsky himself must have in his audience. It is bold, shocking, and perhaps his most <i>""entertaining""</i> film, if only because Tarkovsky for the first time seems to want his audience sympathizing with a protagonist.

Most winsome about <i>The Sacrifice</i> though is its final testament from the fading, sickly Tarkovsky. Ill with lung cancer through part of shooting, one can't escape the finality of his creation. A final, desperate movement of a symphony reaching for the highest note it can before going out.

After all, Alexander's story is, ostensibly, the one of Tarkovsky's himself.

<i>""How is your relationship with god?""</i>

<i>""Nonexistent.""</i>

Both are men who had thought themselves lost among a faithless world, yet ultimately found themselves among the most faithful bastions of god to have been seen through the 20th century.

Among despair, Tarkovsky didn't preen or lurch toward a false hope, he only presented the small, infinitesimal, yet ever-present possibility that redemption could be found. His tombstone read:

2018-06-06,Won't You Be My Neighbor?,2018,https://boxd.it/sNeOJ,4,,"<b> Siff 2018 #4 - The Uptown Cinema<b>

I told Morgan Neville himself after the festival screening of <i>Won't You Be My Neighbor<i> that he had done the unthinkable - cracked the cynical facade of a young millennial. An arduous task of little recorded history. Yet he had done it.

<i>Won't You Be My Neighbor<i> is precisely the film it needs to be. Embodying not necessarily the person of Fred Rogers but rather his top-to-bottom ethos and identity. The film itself exudes his evident kindness and sympathy, a quality rarely found in contemporary multiplexes. Difficult as it is to admit, this film melted my heart.

Every preliminary concern I had about the film was quelled in its opening moment. Rather than begin with news clippings about Mister Roger's show or an overview of his fanbase, we wisely start with what's most important: a moment of pure, unadulterated whimsy in the company of our subject. I won't spoil it here, but needless to say it was an immediate, gasped breathe of joy, and a prudent decision for an archival documentary.

Neville is one of the more endearing and sincere documentarians in recent years, and his emotional dedication to his subjects recalls Albert and David Maysle's classic works of direct cinema (Grey Gardens, Salesman). 

His directorial hand is firm and at times quietly inventive. Near the film's end, Neville's use of talking heads is subverted in a fascinating way. He allows us to reflect on the entirety of Fred Roger's legacy by simply holding on the contented, reflective faces of every interviewee in the film. Lingering on the hopeful lasting effect of a man who moved generations.

I took longest to review <i>Neighbor<i> than any other film I saw at Siff (11 days), and I suppose in retrospect it's a testament to the film's visceral power. I left my screening in a state of quiet reflection and repressed euphoria. So jaded am I that I nearly refused to acclaim the film simply in an effort to rebuff sentimentality. I've fought this internal battle for two weeks, and needless to say, the sentiment and film won out.

<i>Won't You Be My Neighbor<i> is timely in the manner I'd least expected. That in 2018, a Presbyterian preacher-turned children's television host can be the most uplifting example of the human we've seen.

All of his characters in <i>Drunken Angel</i> are simply so tired they can scarcely manage to stand at points. Even the immortally wild Toshiro Mifune turns in a performance of stunning restraint and lax grace.

<i>Drunken Angel</i> is a joy throughout, but particularly shines in its first half, winning from a focus on Takashi Shimura and Mifune's exquisitely weird and charming chemistry. There are fewer pleasures in life to rival Shimura shouting ""fool!"" at Mifune about 50 times through the duration of this 90 minute film.

My favorite moment occurs at the film's 2/3rd mark, when Shimura, a drunken Tuberculosis specialist known for a particular concoction of Sake and tea, catches wind late at night of Mifune's dire condition. He gets out of bed, groans. His nurse rushes over.
<i>""Doctor! Matsunaga's been coughing up blood!""</i>
Shimura looks stern for a moment, ""<i>Huff! Serves him right--!""</i> then turns back to bed.

Coming at a time when Kurosawa's prowess was not yet fully formed, <i>Drunken Angel</i> is much like its title character; a tired, shambling figure of inextricable charm.

An emotional tumult devoid so totally of melodrama that it transcends even the medium of film and blossoms into an engrossing literary tragedy. Here's a film which sickens us until a Kimono begins to resemble a straitjacket.

Few filmmakers had the brass to indict feudal Japan as violently, as vehemently, as unashamedly. Kurosawa was too busy romanticizing the past, while Ozu was preoccupied with the present; only Mizoguchi was the great golden-age Japanese director willing to peek over his shoulder at the injustices lain behind him.

In <i>The Life of Oharu</i>, a punishing and authentic human drama, a noblewoman in 17th-century Japan is shown even in wealth (as she is in the film's beginning) to be powerless. Unable to love, unable to live. Oharu is bartered and flaunted throughout the film as if a glazed pottery.

Ostensibly the <i>12 Years a Slave</i> of women's historical marginalization, <i>Oharu</i> succeeds in much the same way as the former. Rather than hurt the audience physically, Mizoguchi's characteristic style of cerebral camera-movement and lax cutting patterns allows the film to toil away on the screen rather than reach out. It leaves the audience adrift in a sea of ice, only letting us reach gaspingly for our protagonist yet always faltering like the slow dolly shots drifting away from each scene as they end.

Kinuyo Tanaka gives a performance rivaling the strength of Isabelle Huppert in <i>Elle</i>, starring as a woman who carries her avarice even into half-way homes and courtesan shops, until finally she can no more. It's a breathless work of performance - affecting can't begin describing Tanaka's on-screen turmoil.

There were at least three moments during <i>Oharu</i> in which I nearly cried, but the most unforgettable was a sequence near the film's end in which Oharu, now even thrown out of a Buddhist monastery, sits at the Temple's outset; a pitifully crooning waif armed only with the Shamisen in her hands.

<i>""This painful world of transience / How pitiful I am / I'm growing old / This life / Full of regrets""</i>

When one considers <i>Oharu</i>'s narrative, it becomes easy to imagine and wonder... ""just how many Oharu's have there been?""

I'm sure there are many people who will say that <i>The Life of Oharu</i> is a movie churning itself. A film of its kind made for political advance. Some will see it as a forced parable, wringing endlessly about the arbitrary suffering of women.

One of Ozu's precious few films shot in color, it's a practical art museum in and of itself. Each frame is composed as if a sumi-e painting waiting to be framed and hung on a wall. It's one of the most dazzling films ever to behold.

My breath was gone with the first shot; a visual analogy between a sake bottle and a lighthouse which portends the entire narrative. Never has a film convinced me that a sedentary camera could be more interesting than a moving one. This is a landmark achievement.","yasujiro ozu, japanese golden age, japan",2018-06-30
2018-07-03,Rashomon,1950,https://boxd.it/tIjmz,5,Yes,"Its rare that a single cut in film can be exhilarating. Obligatory as they are to convey information, they sometimes transcend their utilitarian use and become miracles in and of themselves.

In Akira Kurosawa's <i>Rashomon</i>, the editing is the star, and each cut is one to be recognized. The fact that this film, requiring numerous flashbacks and flash-forwards, astutely refuses the dissolve... it's a magical incentive for the audience to believe everything they're told. Perfecting the grammar put forth by Eisenstein and Vertov, Kurosawa creates an 88-minute head-first and full steam-ahead roller coaster which only stops when the storm clouds dissipate.

Kurosawa, who was already well-known in Japan at the time for Toho productions such as <i>Drunken Angel</i> and <i>Stray Dog</i>, had cast doubt upon his reputation by taking on such a strange production as <i>Rashomon</i>. His crew didn't understand the script, nor did his producers, nor even Toho (he pitched to Daiei Studios instead). Yet what lay shrouded through that confusion was raw, pure, unfettered innovation.

But it's simple - ungodly simple; 2 crimes, 4 accounts. Like many great films, <i>Rashomon</i> derives its brilliance from an almost mathematical simplicity of design. For its dual crimes and quadruple accounts, every possible drama unfolds before our eyes. The bandit's story -- an errol flynn flight of fancy. The wife's -- a kabuki tragedy. The husband's -- a seppuku tale of desperation. The woodcutter's -- a pessimistic failure of human decency. None true, all real. Kurosawa does not wish the audience to solve a puzzle; any attempt to decode what happened in that grove must lead to insanity. He wants us instead to observe our own acceptance of uncertainty. How willing are we to sit and wait for a truth which is always out of reach?

Perhaps Kurosawa's greatest influence in crafting this film was his much-touted love for Fyodor Doystoyevsky, a russian author whose work mires in distress and existential worry. Though Kurosawa has said that his Jidaigeki (period films) were mostly frivolous entertainment (<i>Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo</i>, etc) while his contemporary films were his prose (<i>Ikiru, High and Low</i>, etc), <i>Rashomon</i> undoubtedly disproves this code of conduct. It’s a film compelled to fester in the rain, scared of itself and the world beyond. Uncertain both factually and morally about its narrative.

What sticks most with me in <i>Rashomon</i> is its pervasive mystery. Like the zone in <i>Stalker</i>, or the chateau in <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i>, the rain-soaked gates of Rashoman are at once enticing and forever inescapable. In a way, the average moviegoer, once introduced to <i>Rashoman</i>, is cursed to forever sit alongside the priest, woodcutter, and commoner to ponder. <i>""I just don't understand--</i>"" the woodcutter will always utter, as the priest sits beside him longingly and the commoner washes his shirt a few feet away. <i>""I just don't understand</i>.""

<i>Rashoman</i> endures much in the same way as Stonehenge or the Great Sphinx of Giza. It's a monument always waiting to be discovered and appreciated, which once seen, you will always return to time and time again, never getting any closer to its majesty than you once were, but always reaching for it nonetheless.","japanese golden age, masterpiece, akira kurosawa, japan",2018-07-02
2018-07-05,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2017,https://boxd.it/tMtTL,5,Yes,"After only 3 viewings I'm convinced this is a masterpiece. A classic of the modern era drenched in obscure but evident contemporary satire and a Bunuel-esque anticipation of horror.

<i>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</i> is not merely a regurgitation of Greek tragedy; it's about the clothed sadism of the american household -- the loathing of a family unit repressed by the banality of wealth. Martin's devilishly karmic punishment upon Stephen is not a tragic subversion of this family's life, but rather a catalyst which exhumes each member's deeply housed hatred for themselves and each other.

Yorgos Lanthimos is the most moral and disciplined of modern filmmakers, and is perhaps second only to Lynne Ramsay in his mastery of the film form. Both share the distinction of being today's most important working filmmakers. His ability to meld satire with horror, mythology with harsh reality, is unprecedented in cinema.

<i>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</i> is an inescapable film about four people living together without ever really knowing one another, and whom only learn of themselves and their opposites through devastating means.

I vacillated throughout on whether Noriko's nuptial trepidation was virtuous or adolescent, but rejoiced in the film's ultimate revelation that the weight of its narrative laid not upon her but rather her father.

The film's final moments are staggering; bursting with loneliness and the bittersweet obligations of paternal love. Only Ozu could linger on the peeling of an apple and leave me steeped in tears because of it. What a beautiful film.","yasujiro ozu, japanese golden age, japan",2018-07-07
2018-07-08,Vertigo,1958,https://boxd.it/tT8Fx,5,Yes,"A total obliteration of the male psyche and its mischievous proclivity toward lust. <i>Vertigo</i> is brazen and bold and totally of itself, benefiting a strange amount from Hitchcock's warped solipsism and because of it is accidentally one of the greatest films ever made. A modern fairy tale which reads like a warning sign for obsession at the intersection of our love and the fantasies swirling about them.

No filmmaker in 1958 had the pomp and circumstance to do what Hitchcock did -- that is, whatever the hell he wanted. Even if that want was to violently explode on-screen with his loathing for the opposite sex, and perhaps to better realize his own self by doing so. <i>Vertigo</i> plays less like a thriller than a big-budget confessional.

Even Hitchcock's plot is a distraction. A fugazi made to lure away studio execs from suspecting his true intention to project himself on-screen. The crippled and self-important Scotty chooses to follow Madeleine at the film's beginning -- but why? It only takes a few additional viewings of <i>Vertigo</i> to realize the uselessness of Gavin Elster's conceit, for any pretense of plot to fall away early-on as you realize that Scotty is in fact following Madeleine for no reasons other than his own.

Fantastic as the film's baffling second-half is, it's the deception of the first which grows increasingly seductive with multiple viewings. Why should Scotty believe Elster's insane ranting? Why does he agree to follow Madeleine? Why fall victim to this terrible plot? Its elliptical narrative and tragic outcome becomes evermore fatalistic with each watch, as if the film is daring you to accept Freud's repetition compulsion as the fundamental thread defining each person's torn, weathered life.

I gave <i>Vertigo</i> 5 stars on Letterboxd upon my first viewing, but honestly didn't care for it... didn't understand it. What I failed to realize is that <i>Vertigo</i> is a film which *actually* needs years of meditation to fully understand. Years of life and love and failures layered upon disaster. It's one of those films which requires everything of you before totally revealing itself.

Narratively simpler than a Douglas Sirk film yet as thematically complex as Proust, <i>Vertigo</i> is a living monument. A masterful and schizophrenic trek into the lust-addled mind of an insane, sick man. A man played by Jimmy Stewart; the ultimate every-man. The portrait of a sick man who inevitably is every man.","masterpiece, alfred hitchcock, jimmy stewart",2018-07-08
2018-07-11,Red Beard,1965,https://boxd.it/tYvef,5,,"One of Kurosawa's most wounded films, <i>Red Beard</i> is a tattered, melancholic experience. A film whose scenes perpetually find themselves ending with characters breaking down in tears -- and I knew how they felt. It is also a triumph of the director's most inspired convictions. A balm of charity, and decency - all existing among a world that scarcely deserves it.

<i>Seven Samurai</i> and <i>Ikiru</i> will always be Akira Kurosawa's undisputed masterpieces, but <i>Red Beard</i> just maybe my very favorite. To see a prolific Japanese director, one whose canonized films had up until this point been action pictures, go-for-broke with a Mizoguchi-esque Jidaigeki drama? It’s one of the great pleasures of my odyssey through cinema.

Just as great, however, is Toshiro Mifune's mesmerizing performance as the eponymous clinic doctor. Mifune's character is so good-natured that he laments having to physically fight several aggressive men, even when his film's audience is just starting to enjoy the spectacle. <i>""This is terrible. Such violence is bad.""</i> Amazing how Kurosawa will challenge his audiences to observe the sincere consequences of the debauchery typically enjoyed in his previous films.

<i>Red Beard</i> was the last film Kurosawa would make with Mifune, and the last he would make for many years as he hit career lows afterwards, not recovering completely until 1980's <i>Kagemusha</i>. In this respect, <i>Red Beard</i> is not only a masterpiece in its own right, but represents the end of an era.

With <i>Red Beard</i>, the Japanese Golden Age of cinema may have come to a close, but without <i>Red Beard</i>, the Japanese cinema in general would've missed one of it's most vital classics. A Kurosawa film not just about class and melodrama, but about people. About the good deeds they commit, the lives they save, and the sins which they’re willing to forgive.","masterpiece, japanese golden age, akira kurosawa, japan",2018-07-10

Selick seems to have had a tough time getting projects off the ground this decade; shameful considering how his <i>Nightmare Before Christmas<i> sits a bona fide classic while his toned proficiency with animation remains severely lacking among films today.

2018-07-16,In the Mood for Love,2000,https://boxd.it/ubve1,5,,"<i>Mood</i> is the key word of this film's title, for it seems to offer that and that alone. It cares so little for plot that scenes are scarcely finished before giving up and moving to the next.

Even then, Wong Kar-Wai's <i>In the Mood for Love</i> is, in a sort of perverse way, not really a love story. It's more about suggestion, for the most intimate things to happen are banal gestures: an insert shot of a cigarette being pegged is alarmingly erotic, as is the sharing of two people's condiments on a plate.

Graciously abandoning some of the more feral, Godardian methods he employed in <i>Chungking Express</i>, Kar-Wai is *restrained* with <i>In the Mood</i>. So restrained in fact that I'd wager one not informed of the title would, as said before, scarcely imagine this to be a love story. It's two leads meander and mope yet never seem to consummate; its the love that almost was, but never can be. When a character pensively considers an apartment door, nearing reunion with his lost love, a title informs us -- ""that era has passed.""

I'm not sure yet whether this deserves a 5.0 rating. I need to think on it for quite some time, as the above notations are all the praise I can verbalize. There's a fleeting suspicion of mine that this film might be air between my clenched hands, but I can't know until I let them go.

A friend of mine once told me, in a discussion about the value of art and romance, that both were futile human interests because science and mathematics are measurable fact while art and romance are not.

Jennifer Fox's <i>The Tale</i> is a dark horse of it's kind, fascinating for its authenticity but infuriating by the same token. As Fox struggles to adapt from documentary to narrative, scenes just simply don't play with the power they should.

Nevertheless, Fox directing her own material is the tool which generates this film's awe and importance; it's a sincere filmic memoir. So rare is this genre and so difficult is its subject matter that altogether <i>The Tale</i> impresses. It's concept of memory is especially lucrative in cinema save for Charlie Kaufman's lot, and Laura Dern's performance is, as always with the gifted actress, superb.

I most admire <i>The Tale</i> for what I see as a distinctly and genuinely sincere, humanist voice in a contemporary conversation often ready to devolve into unfettered bouts of anger and misunderstanding. More voices such as Fox's need to be heard; empathy is a great thing, and film can do that better than any other art. This is what film is for.",,2018-07-20

It seems the great Japanese director wouldn't find peace on-screen until the celebration of life that was 1965's <i>Red Beard</i>.

Toshiro Mifune's performance is the real reason to watch <i>I Live in Fear</i>; I had trepidation about his playing an elderly man at the swaggering age of 35 (only 1 year older then he was in <i>Seven Samurai</i>), but he performs brilliantly, showcasing his range and cementing his talent as more than a kabuki thespian.

2018-07-26,Eighth Grade,2018,https://boxd.it/uzo6n,4,,"Film has always been about the dichotomy between reality and idealized fantasy, about our sobering confrontations with truth railing against escapist temptation. Both are perhaps valid in their own right -- the reality and the fantasy; <i>Eighth Grade</i> falls into the former category. Pioneering YouTube star and comedian Bo Burnham has, at the ripe young age of 27, opted for total candor in his feature-film debut. As freshman cinema director he doesn't simply address contemporary technology, he utterly annihilates it with a vigorous polemic rivaling the 95 theses.

Elsie Fischer stars as Kayla, the eponymous eighth grader grappling with technology and the dawn of her identity vs role confusion epoch. She's as endearing as she is wrongheaded, silently wanting to engage with others while spirited away by the allure of technology's halfway compromise between intimacy and loneliness. She can see everything she wants on Instagram and speak as she wants to a low bit-rate laptop camera on YouTube, so why spring for friends? Burnham doesn't blink for an instant when depicting Kayla's ravenous addiction to the IPhone; she's been haphazardly given the world's loot as Faust was, but her unforeseen consequence is that it comes through a screen, and that no matter how loud the music on her headphones is she can't distract from aching loneliness.

Burnham doesn't shy away from contemporary indie film tropes -- Kayla's tumultuous year is viewed from low tracking shots which prowl behind her, and the score is a thorny mangle of synthesizer and electronic malarkey. Yet what might be cliche in other films has a weight in <i>Eighth Grade</i> by virtue of its contrapuntal use; a swimming pool party is made as frightening as Dante's Inferno with a kubrickian slow zoom, and a scene preceding it has Kayla's grappling in the bathroom depicted like a methadone addict's withdrawal, replete with handheld camera and tight closeups of her mirrored terror. In these moments, <i>Eighth Grade</i> starts to feel more like a gothic horror film than it does a coming-of-age story, and herein lies it's power.

In fact, one could argue that <i>Eighth Grade</i> is a more effective horror film than even recent hit <i>Hereditary</i> because it has the strength of its convictions when addressing human dysfunction. Kayla's enslavement is not occult, it's technological, it's real, and it effects us all. Film is the dichotomy between difficult confrontation and affectionate distraction -- we all like to see the best version of our world when we go to the cinema, one which even if afflicted with troubles is still not afflicted with *our* troubles; <i>Eighth Grade</i>'s virtue is that it refuses such comfort. The death star maybe frightening to Luke, but it's not to us; we have social media to contend with.",,2018-07-26
2018-07-27,Barry Lyndon,1975,https://boxd.it/uzOhV,4.5,,"<b>35mm Screening - Grand Illusion Cinema</b>

Surely one of the most frustrating films ever made, Stanley Kubrick's <i>Barry Lyndon</i> is an arch parable of the most banal garden variety. But just look at it! It's an art gallery worthy of William Hogarth. At times the compositions are so beautiful that they threaten melting to oil. Yet the sad fact remains; Kubrick cares nothing at all for the humans onscreen. Not that he has to, but without even a modicum of labored development among our major characters, Barry's story starts to feel arbitrary -- nothing which happens really matters.

Kubrick was just coming off <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, a film which harbored such political conviction and power that some audiences were driven toward bouts of violence in its wake, threatening law-abiding Brits in the UK and even Kubrick's own tranquil home-life (the film was ultimately banned across the pond for 30 years). Coming off that bacchanal I suppose Kubrick only wished for his family's safety, so rather than make a film broiling with political conviction as he had before, he opted to create one with none at all.

Ryan O' Neal plays the lead character with a distinct lack of charisma, straining to retain his Irish accent as he haplessly stumbles from one major life event to another. Humorously, for every insane development in Barry's life, an only faint recognition is ever found in O' Neal's typically hollowed eyes. He joins the military -- blank stare. He earns the respect of his comrades -- modest contemplation. He's abducted into the Prussian army -- mild concern. If Paul Schrader in his book <i>Transcendentalism in Film</i> defined modern cinema as ""action and empathy,"" then Kubrick's film could be described as ""action and apathy.""

Barry is as interchangeable as the innumerable paintings depicting ""Adoration of the Magi;"" in the end, there were many, but only one was painted by Da Vinci -- Barry was not that one. ""I love the artist's use of the color blue,"" Barry halfheartedly proclaims while viewing one such indistinguishable work of art. With this line, Kubrick maybe mocking the dilettante Barry as he comically feigns high-brow expertise, or he might be mocking the arbitrary expectations of Georgian-era bourgeois... or neither... or both. One really can't say, for perhaps Kubrick himself doesn't know which it is either. He seems clueless about his own material.

It may seem as if I'm down on this film, that I dislike it or begrudge my pleasure derived from it, but this simply isn't true -- I just don't like *most* of it. What sincerely matters in <i>Barry Lyndon</i> is not its characters or fabula, but its production. Perhaps there's a reason Kubrick lavishes time on characters visiting art galleries in his film; its the only place which he sympathizes with. A barefaced installation of beautifully arranged and composed images which are to be admired from about a kilometre back. Like the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, one mustn't get any closer than 6 feet from <i>Barry Lyndon</i>; its sanctity is protected with a velvet rope that shan't be crossed.

One needn't go on about how Kubrick ordered special Zeiss lenses to allow candles to naturally light some interior sequences, nor should the notion be entertained that Kubrick's direction of the moon landing had something to do with NASA's compliant delivery of said lenses. Both are mythologies chiseled into film legend -- my blatant regurgitating will only tire such narratives. The film works wonders parallel to its gossip because of overpowering spectacle. As in his other films, Kubrick's use of music (particularly Handel's Sarabande) is breathtaking and wildly affecting. Battle sequences are gorgeous and objective, while candle-lit domestic interiors and panoramic Irish landscapes lend the film a whiff of epic; it's a ceaseless beauty.

Yet Kubrick is content to keep it that way, and there's only so far a film can go without substance or significance. I've heard some herald <i>Lyndon</i> as a class parable; a condemnation of the aristocracy via their useless dismissal of Barry on caste principal. But let's not be coy here -- Kubrick shifted the novel's first-person perspective to a third-person one for a reason; he doesn't sympathize with anyone. Not Lyndon's ambitious social mobility nor anybody else. His characters are rife for evoking sympathy, from the scheming yet somber expatriate Chevalier to the consistently grieving Lady Lyndon, but Kubrick refuses any such sentiment, reducing both characters to porcelain figures who sit apprehensively but harshly in a low-angle shot. Why? Because... I don't know -- he's Kubrick dammit, and he's a kid from the bronx too adroit for such subtleties. It's funny how an artist's greatest asset can also be his most damning folly.

Nevertheless, <i>Barry Lyndon</i> is a fresco worthy of the Sistine Chapel. It's one of the most sumptuous films ever made -- an exquisite object, but an object nonetheless. Look on dear cinephiles! Though you love and admire this <i>Barry Lyndon</i> of yours, my question is this: ""you see it, but can you touch it?""","stanley kubrick, 35mm, theatre",2018-07-26
2018-08-06,Weekend,1967,https://boxd.it/uXG27,5,,"""<i>Godard's ""Pierrot Le Fou"" (1966) is the same film I liked so much when it opened here in 1968, and assigned a 3.5 [out of 4] star rating. But while I once wrote of it as ""Godard's most virtuoso display of his mastery of Hollywood genres,"" I now see it more as the story of silly characters who have seen too many Hollywood movies.<i>""
- Roger Ebert, 2007

Godard is a filmmaker to grow out of. There was a time in the counter-cultural zenith of the mid-1960s when art house intellectuals and NYU students touting Maxim Gorky would line around the block in urban centers to admire his films. They were beguiling, they were anarchic, and they belonged to their time and the yippie audiences which enjoyed them. Alas, such days of being wild weren't to last, and little could Godard have predicted the 1980s.

<i>Weekend<i> is one of Godard's best-aged works -- because it doesn't celebrate counter-culture, but rather challenges it. Like Burgess dared to confront England's dormant fascism with <i>A Clockwork Orange<i>, Godard says that bourgeois complacency lives and breathes even perhaps in the new-age communes wherein many seek refuge. Feral ideology still undercuts even the vanguard.

The film is also Godard's most sadistic and least friendly work. It assaults its viewers with apocalyptic violence against children, animals (PETA would *not* be happy watching this film) and just about every sentient being within the Nouvelle Vague's reach. Lars Von Trier's entire cinematic ethos must've been founded on this loathsome, cynical, sadistic, brilliant film.

I wonder much of the time whether films which leap for didacticism are cinema in its highest form or a regression to propaganda, and such a question is emblematic of my struggle through <i>Weekend<i>. Disregarding the film's potentially Marxist convictions, is it noble for an artist to think so little of his audience that he feels obligated to teach them? In this respect, <I>Weekend<i> is a terrible film, and a work in harmony with Leni Riefenstahl's oeuvre. 

Yet I don't think Godard is that certain -- he doesn't preach Che Guevara through <i>Weekend<i>'s runtime; he throws such radical theologies in our face and let's us soak in them, but not accept them. He wishes only to provoke, not to teach, as a great writer or filmmaker should. He's only supplying the manifesto knowingly, waiting to watch for if we sign it, or tear it in two.",,2018-08-05
2018-08-09,Falling Down,1993,https://boxd.it/v5DJN,0.5,,"Here's a film which opens with an homage to Fellini's <i>8 1/2</i> and ends like a cut-rate <i>Death Wish</i>.

<i>Falling Down</i> is an embarrassment. A monument to nihilism which cares so little about itself that it even betrays its own ""angry white man"" logic two-thirds of the way through by retconning its protagonist's normality. It's a limp attempt to claim moral backbone, but transparently a lie. It's barely even a gnarled facade. It's barely even trying.

The film agrees with its protagonist -- there's no two ways about it. Director Joel Schumacher has no compunction about deifying this ""avenging archangel."" Speaking of which, though the inexorably maligned Schumacher may have <i>Batman and Robin</i> to grapple with in the court of public opinion, reality itself beckons him to repent for *this* movie. The man's most heinous sin, even with <i>Batman and Robin</i> to his credit, is still <i>Falling Down</i>. The film's title is a confession.

<i>Falling Down</i> pretends to have knowing social commentary, yet the most damning and profound observation it can muster is, (gasp!), that the burgers you get served at McDonald's look nothing like the ones they market! Whaaat!

It's a film in which Michael Douglas (a great and usually moral actor) dawns a white dress shirt and tie to be an even more offensive and lazy fascist vigilante than Charles Bronson.

It's a film in which said vigilante berates a comical South Korean immigrant straw man by asking -- ""how dare you come to my country and charge me 85 cents for a soda! Do you know how much aid the U.S. has given to Korea?"" then proceeds to browbeat the man by destroying half of his stock and threatening his life.

It's a film in which a homeless man (and by extension ALL homeless persons as the film would seem to imply) is cloying and inhuman rather than benighted, and to whom the protagonist's supposedly measured response is the reliably old and distinctly conservative ""why don't you just get a damn job?""

It's a film which pays lip-service to race politics by including a moment wherein Douglas finds a black man, clad in dress identical to his own, picketing outside a bank with a sign that reads ""Am I not economically viable?"" who is then arrested for his protest -- but not before he looks out the window of the squad car and whispers ""don't forget about me,"" while him and Douglas exchange nods in solidarity.

It's a film in which audiences are meant to applaud when Douglas' character, confronted with a neo-Nazi who claims ""we're the same you and I,"" responds with the inspirational retort -- ""no we're not. You're a sick asshole, and I’m an American.""

(clap clap clap clap clap).

The 2015 Chapel Hill shooting was, I think, mistaken for a hate crime--the perpetrator I think was only subconsciously motivated by race--and the evidence is found in a testimony from the murderer's wife: ""His favorite movie was <i>Falling Down</i>. He watched it incessantly. He thought it was hilarious."" Stephen Hick's murder of three people was founded on entitlement and an eerily intellectualized nihilism, and unlike other, similar films which have inspired real-life violence (i.e. <i>Taxi Driver</i> or <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>), <i>Falling Down</i> wasn't constructed knowingly by it's filmmakers and not only fails to intelligently go about portraying a sick person, but actually AGREES with that sick person's toxic ethos.

In fact, <i>Falling Down</i> agrees with its protagonist so much that it's no surprise someone such as Hicks watched the film and felt compelled by its wretched entitlement to wave around pistols in a parking lot, and to murder two innocent university students on the basis that ""they parked in the visitors lot when they were actually students.""

Still worse is how tritely the film attempts to briefly condemn its protagonist at the end before abruptly vindicating him. The screenwriter only inserts Robert Duvall's retired cop character and his ""level-headed"" monologue into the story's ending so as to paint a thin veneer of ethical character over this dreary and miserable film -- and to muddy the water over whether it agrees with the protagonist's lurid worldview (which it does).

<i>Falling Down</i> is a mockery, an insult, a travesty; a stain on this country, its middle class, and a lasting reminder of humanity's worst, most complacent proclivities. Its modern day equivalent would be surfing through the ""Affirmative Action"" board on 4chan. It's like a creepy insight into every unemployed, trust-funded, nihilistic reddit user's most intimate thoughts.

The best thing I suppose you could say about <i>Falling Down</i> is that after watching it you'll have a distinct picture of the Chapel Hill murderer's worldview.

He is tired and ragged, governed by principles so austere that even serenading a dinner table enrages his ethical character. His skin is so thick that grief can't reach the surface, and what makes <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i> so masterful is that the Coens never let it.

Much like their other masterpiece <i>A Serious Man</i> (likely their best film), <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i> is a test of endurance and repression. The Coen bros. run their protagonist through an unforgiving mill and wonder aloud if he can come out the other side. Needless to say Llewyn can't.

Oscar Isaac embodies a pretentious sort of last-rope Beatnik ideology; the Coens thought they'd never find an appropriate star, one who could sing and act with equal prowess, yet o' golly how they were wrong. Isaac should abandon Poe Dameron -- he's a Brando in waiting, and <i>Llewyn Davis</i> is a testament to that. Entire volumes of character are communicated in fleeting reaction shots, as per usual with the Coens' editing, and Isaac emotes quietly, brilliantly, and silently.

Unique among the upper echelons of cinema are the Coens. While most prolific filmmakers define themselves by visual style, a subject, or craft itself, the brothers remain individual through sheer voice -- like Joyce or Hemingway or Pynchon, they evince tone and worldview beyond the form itself. Whether written or filmed or spoken over a dinner table, one suspects Joel and Ethan would elucidate the same narrative.

Few of the Coens' narratives are this despairing though; even <i>Fargo</i> seems like an upbeat farce compared to <i>Llewyn Davis</i>, perhaps because the former at least finds certainty among designating its most moral characters. In <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i> there is no north star to guide our character, there is no compass. He tries and he fails, and that is the course of his life and many others. It's a narrative trajectory few tread because it cuts so close to a universally human bone.

It's sad. It keeps me up at night. To imagine Llewyn toiling away at the bottom for an eternity as so many must have. The fleeting uselessness of his life and others -- perhaps the Coen bros. pessimism is infectious. Yet <i>Llewyn Davis</i> surpasses most of the filmmaking duo's other work for the simple reason of sympathy. <i>The Big Lebowski</i> is a great, fun film, but look at it probingly -- it's a despairing work; a comical portrait of ineffective ex-counterculturalists who similarly toil away in bowling alleys in spite of their noble pasts. Remember, The Dude was a member of the Seattle Seven.

But rather than slander the misbegotten rugged individual as they did with <i>Lebowski</i>, the Coens wistfully sing dirges to them. The brothers have softened with age perhaps, and <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i> is their elegy to all those ineffectual floating weeds whom they've lambasted in the past. A letter of apology to the bohemians who dare to be in spite of the world around them.","masterpiece, coens",2018-08-19
2018-09-11,Last Year at Marienbad,1961,https://boxd.it/woS2r,5,Yes,"Remains an unsurpassed milestone of cinema. Pretentious in the best possible sense and as uncompromisingly gothic as a Hieronymus Bosch portrait.

<i>The Shining<i> could not exist without this, <i>Eraserhead<i> could not exist without this -- in fact David Lynch's entire filmography mightn't existed without this.

One needn't look farther than the film's trailer to uncover <i>Last Year at Marienbad<i>'s simple mantra: ""You have all the pieces -- you must create the narrative yourself."" It's like an ominous apartment with no key, a hollowed stump with no entry, a Raymond Chandler novel in which the audience must be Phillip Marlowe.

I've seen the film 3 times now, and still I'm nearly driven to tears at points while watching.

2018-09-23,Fahrenheit 11/9,2018,https://boxd.it/wOpyZ,3.5,,"Many strange and unbelievable things have happened in 2018, but perhaps the strangest and most unbelievable of them all is that Michael Moore has now made a film so angry he's eclipsed Spike Lee.

Indiewire journalist and Letterboxd luminary David Ehrlich has made an all-too accurate observation in calling 2018-era Moore ""tired,"" tired and defeated. Yet what belies that defeat is a determimed rebirth of sorts. After nearly three decades of politically-charged filmmaking and passionate socialist pleading, the Flint, Michigan native has finally resigned his composure and allowed himself the role of baptized revolutionary -- something akin to Jean-Luc Godard during his Maoist period. Moore, moreso than ever before, is prepared to tear out the paving stones beneath him and toss them at the proverbial sitting presidency. I half expected his newest film to end with, as per Godard's <i>Vent D'est</i>, a how-to segment about crafting molotov cocktails.

<i>Fahrenheit 11/9</i> is... let's see -- <b>not</b> what I expected. It is not a 2-hour take-down of our sitting president, nor is it an ordinary leftist reading of contemporary politics. It is a downright analog to Godard's <i>Weekend</i>. Two hours of Moore's most personal ruminations and tribulations; his failures and defeats. A summation of his work which ends with an indirect profession of self-loathing and a call for revolution. Surprisingly, the film's most resonant material emanates not from the white house, but from (where else!) Flint, Michigan. That fact alone emphasizes just how personal and sordid this material is to Michael Moore.

Wearing, however, are the first 20 or so minutes; an opening movement devoted entirely to Donald Trump. Moore reaches for some low-hanging fruit in this segment, addressing commonplace facets of the 2016 election and Trump himself. A comical evocation of Hillary Clinton's botched victory party proves funny but inevitable (and expected), as does a sensationalist recount of Trump's uncomfortable relationship with his daughter Ivanka. Both tidbits fare OK as fodder for Moore, but its not until reaching Flint that <i>Fahrenheit 11/9</i> violently hits its stride.

Once back in his hometown, Moore thrives on the Flint water crisis and exploits it as the fulcrum of his audience's sympathy for working-class America. His polemic cast upon Rick Snyder is the most convincing in the whole movie, and how he also ties the sometimes deified Barack Obama into Flint's crisis narrative is almost too poignant to bare. Equally powerful are Moore's reflections on the Parkland student activists (whose rallying political spirit clearly inspires him) and the perceived ""new"" democratic left, which Moore sees embodied in figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib.

Powerful as some of these segments are however, one can't shake this irreconcilable feeling throughout <i>Fahrenheit 11/9</i> that its world-weariness and concluding call-to-action is, well, untenable in practice. Moore has perhaps reached the tipping point of ethical conviction, trying for honesty and equity with such fury that he forgets how to cater to his audience and the institutions currently in place. Somehow in his incredible frustration with this country, Moore has neglected the most sacred tool of all politicians and pundits; quiet manipulation. One can see Moore's impatience on recent late-night television interviews. Even those who should be his liberal pals have turned sour and grown afraid of him -- it's not too difficult to see worried looks and defensive posturing on behalf of Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert in recent interviews they gave of Moore.

Perhaps most sad about <i>Fahrenheit 11/9</i> is that, because of this alienation from mainstream liberal thought, the film will likely flop at the box office. Moore has clearly made his nonpartisan magnum opus; a summation and reflection on his own work which seems poised to be his last major achievment. Yet in divided times as these, his voice will be shrouded and lost amidst the noise. There was a time when America might've needed Michael Moore, but it seems that time has either faded or disappeared entirely. Should <i>Fahrenheit 11/9</i> continue to fail at the box office, the latter will be proven.

Letterboxd and it's users admittedly seem aligned with the audiences dodging <i>Fahrenheit 11/9</i> -- heedlessly waving away any political nightmare which could besiege their slightly coddled existence. Their type is the very one which Michael Moore warns of, and theirs is the very type which will (in all honesty) most likely dismiss this review, refuse to like it, and continue to ignore or dismiss a political dialogue happening all around them. Such is the type which nearly averted my writing this review, and compelled me to think twice before posting anything political to Letterboxd. Yet some part of me was compelled with even greater fervor to write in spite of that trepidation, and perhaps that fervor is a testament to Michael Moore and his unexpectedly impassioned film.",,2018-09-22
2018-10-01,Donnie Darko,2001,https://boxd.it/x6u0z,3.5,Yes,"Uk. This is... not as good as I remember it.

A bit too hoity-toity and convinced of it's own self-importance to be truly remarkable. It seems like Richard Kelly was young and passionate and too preoccupied with himself, though I suppose that restless conviction is what makes <i>Donnie Darko<i> appealing to so many people.

I realize that taking this position of condescending towards a 25-year-old self-indulgent writer/director with a superiority complex is in itself a superiority complex all its own on my behalf, yet I can't help if my candor is elitist -- this movie is solipsistic and deluded. There's a critical difference between Kelly's narrative engineering and say.. David Lynch's. The latter works effortlessly to disgorge his subconscious. Kelly seems to manufacture profundity.

There is an element of genius to <i>Darko<i> and <i>Southland Tales<i> and even <i>The Box<i>; this I concede. Nevertheless, Kelly's voice during this period was just too young, too unripened, for any of his excess ideas to resonate meaningfully, or to engage on any intellectual level more evolved than a late-night, marijuana-fueled conversation you had with your college dormmate about death and time and stuff. 

Perhaps <i>Darko<i> will always remain a fixture in the popular culture, which I suppose for the film's ambition alone it certainly deserves. But Richard Kelly could, if he were working today, probably outdo this film's sophomoric ruminations in a heartbeat. It's just a damn shame that he's been put in Director's jail it seems.

<i>Donnie Darko<i> used to be a very important film to me. I watched it dozens of times in the 6th grade. But then something happened -- life intervened, and now I find myself a stranger to its restless intellectual exploration and impassioned tirades against banality. It tires me. I feel old, yet I'm really not though.",,2018-10-01
2018-10-18,A Serious Man,2009,https://boxd.it/xKQj9,5,Yes,"Short and stocky Larry Gopnik holds the phone to his ear and quietly protests -- ""that's right, I haven't done anything."" The voice on the other end of the telephone insists he subscribes to the Columbia Record Club; ""to receive the monthly main selection--you do nothing."" Neither of these persons wish conversation with the other; neither considers their opponent's plight, yet each jabbers on in eager despair regardless, trying and failing to convince the other of their inherent stupidity.

This situation is the quintessential Coen invention, one in which the straight-laced necessities of American life clash with uncertainty and impatience. Lawrence Gopnik has indeed done nothing, but in a world moving as fast as our own, doing <i>nothing</i> and standing still is the same as moving backwards.

<i>A Serious Man</i> is, I firmly believe, the Coens' best film. It is their most personal film and their finest high-wire act between comedy and tragedy. It is also a companion piece in every conceivable way to their 2013 masterpiece <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i>. Both are modern interpretations of myth: <i>Serious Man</i> is about a contemporary Job, while <i>Davis</i> is their homespun Sisyphus.

Both stories are about men, hard-working and devoted, who face indescribable tribulation on their journey toward nothingness. While <i>Davis</i> is certainly the most guttural and affecting of the two, <i>A Serious Man</i> eclipses it for the winced laughter it generates from such a despairing portrait. It mocks Gopnik's suffering rather than laments it, and because of that is the most complete summation of the Coens' jaded worldview.

For most of it's runtime, <i>A Serious Man</i> is something like watching a pickled open-wound repeatedly splashed with increasingly greater quantities of vinegar. It's protagonist endures the following trials:

1. A failing student attempts to bribe him.
2. His wife requests a divorce so that she can run off with his friend.
3. His brother is accused of sodomy....
and many, many more issues evolve from there.

And what is Larry's ultimate lesson? Well, perhaps its the same as Lee Sussman's -- forget about the issue and receive with simplicity all that happens to you. So is doing nothing the solution? Or is it the problem? Or should we be asking questions, or not? Or... wait, what's going on?

Such are the byzantine corridors of confusion which haunt <i>A Serious Man</i>, and such are the woes which should haunt any decently intelligent person grappling with life's complexities.

<i>A Serious Man</i> is the story of a man who does nothing, but it’s also the story of a man who, because of that, has in fact done <i>less</i> than nothing. Larry Gopnik expects each problem he's confronted with to be rebuffed successfully by this same plea: ""but I haven't done anything?""

David Fincher is the great hypochondriac of cinema — he can make you dizzy with a mere fleeting suspicion. Perhaps then, more appropriately, he is cinema’s premier paranoiac. 

<i>Zodiac</i> is his two and a half hour embrace of this ambiguous, obssessive, self-destructive fervor. A monument to all that is nebulous and unknown and potentially hiding behind our backs at night while we least suspect it.

Seriously though; 11 years and somehow I didn’t watch this until tonight. I can’t speak for certain since I’m still reeling from the film’s closing moment, but nevertheless I have a sneaking suspicion that with time this will become one of my favorite films.

2018-11-05,Suspiria,2018,https://boxd.it/yrybn,4,,"Luca Guadagnino is a great filmmaker not because of voice but because of technique. You don't just listen to and <i>watch<i> his films--the other 3 senses take precedence: you touch, smell, and taste (anyone whose witnessed the infamous ""Peach Scene"" from <i>Call Me By Your Name<i> can certainly vouch for the latter stimuli).

It should only make immaculately perfect sense then that Guadagnino pursue Horror, perhaps his best-suited genre. Indeed, the guttural nature of his filmmaking works gangbusters upon the bone-crunching, viscera-spewing sequences of <i>Suspiria<i>, yet weirdly those sequences are minimal. By and large this is a semi-botched half political allegory and half body horror and half psychological thriller stew of crazy which doesn't quite congeal.

Stranger yet is that the semi-botched political allegory seems to work better than the horror. Lutz Ebersdorf is the best part of this movie, and by that I mean not just the character ""he"" plays but also the woman who happens to play him. Swinton and Gudagnino have said they were simply fooling by filling the role of an 82-year old german man with a 57 year-old british woman, yet that decision seems weirdly crucial. Swinton gives the best performance of her career as this 82-year old psychoanalyst. It's an even greater gender-bending performance than Sally Potter's <i>Orlando<i>, and it carries an almost frightening amount of pathos. Ebersdorf/Swinton's closing scene is one to behold--genuinely devastating and teeming with the sorrow of each respective gender's historic faults, afflictions, failures, and atrocities. It's one of the most moving stretches of film I can think of in the past few years, and it seems only possible with the advent of this dual-gendered combo of past and present.

That Swinton's enthralling poignancy never quite connects with <i>Suspiria<i>'s horror premise is just as sorrowful as the previously mentioned closing scene. With some tweaking, this could've been one of the great ""post-horror"" films of the decade, yet even at two and a half hours the film's two-halves are unable to reconcile. Nevertheless, much like last year's equally insane and confrontational <i>Mother<i>, <i>Suspiria<i> warrants viewing if only for its ambition and brief glimpses of genius. It's lost potential aside, the film remains an immersive and dreadful horror experience which will likely age just as well as its namesake predecessor.

<i>P.S. I'm not even going to try comparing this to Argento's original -- needless to say this is entirely its own film and really ought to be called a ""cover"" rather than a remake, if that.<i>",,2018-11-03
2018-11-08,Barry Lyndon,1975,https://boxd.it/yy8hX,5,Yes,"It's not about people--this I've realized. Rather, Kubrick's <i>Barry Lyndon</i> is about animals--human animals whose sole intent is to flatter their own egos, to acquire a mate, to protect their kin, to arbitrarily preserve their lives. There are no humans in <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, and that's precisely the point.

Stephen King once said that Stanley Kubrick's <i>The Shining</i> was like ""looking at ants on an ant hill."" Only now do I know what he meant. What made Kubrick the preeminent director of his time was not simply his craft; it was that he saw no pretense. He was impressed by nobody, unswayed by ideology, and unconvinced that humans had intrinsic value. In this respect, <i>Barry Lyndon</i> is his most singular portrait of mankind. Whose to say Barry is any different from the apes in <i>2001</i>?

In fact, the moment I realized <i>Barry Lyndon</i> was a masterpiece was during a re-watch of Alain Resnais' <i>Mon Oncle d'Amerique</i> -- a film narrated by a behavioral scientist in which the lives of three characters are made analogous to mice in cages. ""How different,"" I thought, ""are these mice from the characters in <i>Barry Lyndon</i>."" A voice sang from the deepest, most logical, and least sentimental part of my mind--""they aren't."" <i>Barry Lyndon</i> is like Resnais' film except it doesn't tell the audience about those mice.

Probably the most vivid articulation of David Byrne's internal, screaming insanity that us humans will ever have access to. Any film with 50 sets of twins stored covertly somewhere in its bones is likely to be most unlike any other, and with David Byrne at the helm one can expect nothing less than that wild conceit compounded upon hundreds more. Quirkiness overload.

Yet unlike similar deep-dives into a director's subconscious such as <i>Synecdoche, New York</i> or even <i>Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</i>, there's not much coherence in the dream logic of <i>True Stories</i>. For all its wild existential conceits and gorgeous visuals (rendered more beautifully than ever before on Criterion), its a tiring slog--or not slog, that's too harsh; perhaps picaresque bedtime story is a better description. Fabled and pretty but sort of fleeting and immemorable.

""Indulgent"" is a pejorative tossed around much too often. I think many of the greatest films ever made and novels written are indulgent. So its not sheer solipsism which hampers <i>True Stories</i>--just a wistfully overwrought desire to be unique.",,2018-11-23
2018-11-29,The House That Jack Built,2018,https://boxd.it/zpSLF,4.5,,"<b>Watched Unrated Director's Cut at Siff Cinema Uptown</b>

Glad to see Lars Von Trier has finally thrown up his arms in defeat and given audiences an intimate autobiography. Not since <i>All That Jazz</i> has a film so thoroughly reflected its director's life story.

I've not enjoyed most of Von Trier's films--only tolerated them. I admire his audacity yet am estranged by his nihilistic ruminations. <i>The House That Jack Built</i> however, is Von Trier's greatest work. But not because it reneges his lurid worldview; on the contrary, Von Trier's soul-piercing dislike for the human animal radiates so intensely throughout this magnum opus that it reaches a sort of zenith impossible to ignore.

Like Lars Von Trier himself, Jack is an almost frighteningly perceptive engineer of sadism. A man reconciling his fierce self-loathing but unsure whether to do so with construction or decay. Of course in both men's cases, the latter option is pursued.

Much has been written of the film's violence: rifle-shot through the forehead of a child, dismembering of a duck, severing of a woman's breasts, etc. Yet what's most disconcerting having now seen the film is just how scarce the on-screen depravity is. In strict adherence to the Kenji Mizoguchi/Michael Haneke-arthouse tradition, most of the film's perverse incidents of sadism remain just off-screen. This makes one wonder--what in the hell could possibly be on display in the R-rated cut? It seems unthinkable that with what (relatively) little explicit violence is exhibited in the unrated edition that the R-rated cut could possibly exclude anymore of the already (relatively) slight graphic imagery.

Most of all, what could the MPAA possibly have to bemoan and litigate over for <i>Jack</i> when <i>Hostel</i> back in 2006 was able to pass for an R rating with explicit images of buzz-saws colliding with arteries and severed tendons faltering violently? Of course this is only scratching the surface of the MPAA's deep-seeded commercial biases and, in this transparent case, ideological myopia. <i>The House That Jack Built</i> is not explicit because of its imagery--its explicit because of its ideas, and that's an appraisal the likes of which even Godard's Maoist propaganda films could scarcely earn.

My audience exhibited a bizarre and fascinating behavior through the film's first hour--near constant laughter. Admittedly, we were primed for riotous abandon by Von Trier's special ""American"" introduction to the movie; a prelude which ends with the director himself dryly stating ""good luck--and never another Trump,"" (needless to say this generated a huge applause from the Seattleite audience of which I was a part). But then... Incident 3 (of the films 5 presented incidents) was unfolded before us. The audience fell silent. People began looking at the floor. They searched the auditorium in hopes of fixing their eyes to something more pleasing than their own humiliation which lay devastatingly clear on the screen.

They lamented their laughs. Unlike Jack, the audience wished to repent, but they couldn't--for their earlier abandon had already sounded, and helped fuel the film's violent power. This implicating the audience in sadism is perhaps the key genius which <i>The House That Jack Built</i> possesses.

Roger Ebert once wrote of David Fincher's <i>Zodiac</i> that it was brilliant not in spite of its excluding the eponymous serial killer's plight, but because of it. Von Trier, being the man he is, couldn't even start to imagine any perspective besides that of the serial killer's; and because for once the famous auteur, psychopath, dictator, sadist, fascist libertine, and filmmaker--has finally decided to betray his nihilistic vision unfettered and untroubled, he's been able to express with a new and stunning clarity that most seminal of cynical utterances.

Chantal Akerman and Yasujiro Ozu knew that film didn't have to *move* or hurry to be great. The camera can simply sit, or observe like a child from across the street. Alfonso Cuaron has come of age because with <i>Roma</i> he makes his audience that kid across the street. Finally Cuaron has stiffened his restless camera and let his audience search the frame instead of the camera searching itself. The great Mexican director has become one of Paul Schrader's transcendentalists--creating a film whose purpose is greater than to entertain. He wants to absorb us.

One gets gets the sense all throughout <i>Roma</i> of being in the grip of a master, of being completely immersed in a world without any worry of a studio light falling or a boom mic entering frame. For the just-over two hours of <i>Roma</i>'s runtime a whole world exists unto itself, like the endless, autobiographical streets of New York built under a single warehouse in <i>Synecdoche, New York</i>--Cuaron fits all of Mexico City into a canvas the size of a movie screen.

Cinerama's Dolby Atmos sound system may be most to thank for this total immersion. <i>Roma</i>'s soundscape is rife with details so minute that after a time I wasn't sure if the theater's munching popcorn was it's own or the movie's. Just the opening sequence alone, a bucket of water splashing the linoleum floor of an upper-class home, has a soothing, swashing fidelity about its sound design. None of this would be as vivid however if it weren't in a theater (on that subject: it should be a criminal offense to stream this at home. Criminal).

I could go on like this... talking about and praising the film's sound mixing (gorgeous), acting (Yalitza Aparicio could light up a church with her smile she's so good), cinematography (credited to Alfonso Cuaron!), etc. But all that praise pales in comparison to the cinematic experience itself.

There's a line in Edward Yang's <i>Yi Yi</i> in which a character is asked why they adore movies. ""We live three times as long since man invented movies; they give us twice what we get from daily living. Life is a mixture of happy and sad things; movies are too -- and that's why we love them.""

Netflix MUST give this the theatrical release it deserves.

Ek. Ew. Ek. Ek. Ek. Ek. Ew. Ek. Ek. Ek.

I hate it. I hate this--this artless, pointless, terrible, horrible, no good very bad stitching together of one inelegantly composed shot following another while capturing listless people spouting inarticulate, directionless dialogue, who every once in a while shout for their lives with those many recycled and overused horror-movie intonations. ""PLEASE! PLEASE!"" ""NO! NO DON'T!"" NO DON'T DO THAT!"" Soon comes the senseless and unproductive screaming while their viscera spews: ""AH! AH!"" ""AHHHH!"" ""OH... OH GOD!"" OH GOD"" OH...! OH GOD!""

Phew. I need to stop. Rarely do I allow my written voice to devolve into vulgarity; brief exclamations, terse statements, broad generalizations, and unsubstantiated accusations. No, Eli Roth is not a white-hooded evangelist of the alt-right. That's a preposterous accusation. Naming him a Klansman would imply his filmic vision possesses pathos or ideology. Ha! What a privilege that might've been to encounter through <i>The Green Inferno</i>. All that lay in its place is what truly constitutes Eli Roth's deepest annals of character--infantile, sadistic playtime belonging to a 12-year old boy's sandbox; fobbed off as “homage” to <i>Cannibal Holocaust </i>as an excuse for its blithe tonal schizophrenia. Marquis de Sade wouldn't enjoy <i>The Green Inferno</i>; he'd be bored out of all conceivable recognition by it. Maybe he'd laugh. Me, I was bored.

Bored I would've been if the film hadn't shoehorned-in its political ""subtext,"" or rather ""over and above the atmosphere-obvious-text"" if one chooses to depart from literary parlance and favor accuracy. Had <i>The Green Inferno</i> remained content to gouge out eyes and slice abdomens free of context, it would've been passing for its genre. I still would've hated it, but it would've passed. With its embarrassingly half-cooked and dimwitted political ""message,"" it suffers the same fate as Roth's earlier two <i>Hostel</i> movies, becoming an underhanded propaganda film derelict of any redeeming qualities. All three movies espouse a worldview so simultaneously cynical, naive, and utterly insulated that it begs belief.

I'd be even more critical of Roth had he not recently directed <i>The House with a Clock in its Walls</i>--not because that film was good but because it was hackneyed and serviceable, proving he's at least capable of performing a job of marginal worth, even if that worth is delivering sums of cash to a Hollywood distributor. It takes a different sort of cynicism to do that, but one which is at least productive in a sense, unlike <i>The Green Inferno</i> which is distinctly *unproductive* in every sense known within both the greater and minor context of western civilization.

Anyway, I've said enough. This film doesn't deserve the shoddy video file its encoded on. If it were downloaded onto my computer--and occupied just half a gigabyte of storage on my terabyte hard-drive--it would still be far too much, because it'd be more than zero. If there's anyone who enjoys this movie in any capacity, I want that person to prostrate themselves before me and dictate a long, eloquent prose poem explaining themselves and their position. Only then may I muster enough intellectual strength to nod in sympathy and kick them in the teeth.

2018-12-28,The Favourite,2018,https://boxd.it/AGUIr,4.5,,"When race ducks are more reliable than people, you know there's a problem.

Yorgos Lanthimos reminds me of--(mocking gasp)--Stanley Kubrick; he's so disinterested in people (i.e. as special individuals) that their psychology is often informed by self-preservation and nothing else. An intrinsic pessimism uncomfortable for many but likely accurate. 

<i>The Favourite<i> is founded on such pessimism. As good as its lead three actresses are, they're nevertheless in service of prescribed roles defined less by character than by class, hierarchy, and epoch. Though they dress nicely and speak king's english, they may as well be rats in a Skinner Box--reacting to stimuli with the requisite gratification or aggression which a behavioral psychologist with an HRM and a bit of wit could predict with ease.

I love this movie. I'm as cynical as its director and aspire to be as depraved as its characters. To watch an Oscar-contending film so gleefully bereft of diegetic morality is quite honestly thrilling.</i></i>",theatre,2018-12-27
2018-12-29,Talk Radio,1988,https://boxd.it/ALguz,4.5,,"Oliver Stone's films have ranged from merely decent to downright balderdash and boring since his initial success <i>Platoon</i>. I've always thought him a filmmaker who, like Robert Altman, may have been a far greater novelist than movie director had he pursued that line of artistic endeavor.

Strange then that his best film in my opinion, <i>Talk Radio</i>, is based on a chamber-piece stage production. By narrowing his scope, Stone engrosses his audience with a confidence far greater than I've seen anywhere else in his filmography.

<i>Talk Radio</i> is a series of taught, cynical exchanges between radio host Barry Champlain and his Dallas listeners--who call into his high-rise studio during the program to confess anguish, fury, and in some interesting cases, pity. Barry sits, often rim lit, while leaning forward intently with a headset, coffee mug, and nihilistic disposition. He abhors his listeners who often are either spiteful neo-Nazis out to skewer his Jewish head on a spigot, or complacent intellectuals who smugly consume his outrage as self-validation. Witnessing his moral and emotional collapse through the films relatively slim 100-minute runtime is surprisingly mesmerizing.

This is a film made in 1988 yet residually a product of the 1970s. A putrefied, outraged, yet undeniably moral film which rivals Sidney Lumet's 1976 masterpiece <i>Network</i> in its damning indictment of American stupidity and media complicity. It's also not difficult to recognize a similarity in Barry's story to noted 1960s comedian-turned martyr for free speech Lenny Bruce--who similarly railed against an establishment he detested and ultimately suffered at its dirty hands for his own moralizing gall.

Stone's candid depiction of ""rebel"" as more sad-sack than hero is admirable. Barry Champlain can't claim moral superiority for edifying--with insensitive shrieks--desperate low-lifes, street rats, and drug addicts. He's not educating them, but provoking them, and knowingly so. What's more, By granting them attention solely for profit, he in his own way has sunken to their fringe stupor; condemning a corrupt system while also, as he admits, ""embracing it.""

His saga is one to behold. It's toxic and embittered and very, very Jewish. In other words, precisely the sort of thing I adore. This is what can fairly be called an under-seen gem--more than that; a true diamond in the rough, albeit one which is dirtied and takes some warming up to.",better than you think,2018-12-29
2019-01-01,Shoplifters,2018,https://boxd.it/AUHOf,4.5,,"There's a moment in Hirokazu Kore-eda's <i>Shoplifters</i> when Aki, a young and destitute woman living on the outskirts of Tokyo, decides to meet with one of her clients after work for a private rendezvous. Mind you--she's a stripper working in a peep show. She and the client embrace in a darkened backroom dimly lit by red neon. They both embrace quietly and realize through desultory conversation that--unbeknownst to them--they share emotional and even physical scars similar enough to inspire a profound, mutual connection.

Scoff all you like at this sentimentality, but within context of the film's tone, it's a scene of rare beauty. Most of all it's earned by the filmmaker because it doesn't simply apparate communion as if a parlor trick--rather it complements an omniscient darkness amidst our characters' world with a fleeting glimpse of hope. Such a dichotomy is what indicates the mastery of storytelling at the heart of <i>Shoplifters</i>.

Kore-eda's film is a leisurely tour through its central family's thorny but joyous existence. As per the title they are indeed shoplifters, scouring bodegas and corner stores for a needed meal, but in spite of this regular criminal transgression they are above all loving, kind, and familial. Kore-eda understands that a person's objective faults need not impede upon their ability to love. As Walt Whitman once wrote immortally: ""I am large. I contain multitudes."" Humans are a crazy animal after all; able to love while hate, steal while give, adopt while kidnap, etc.

Of course the latter of these paradoxes informs <i>Shoplifters</i>' narrative. All through the film, the question of this family units origin is a dubious one. Are these two ""parents"" married? Is this boy their child? Whose the young woman? Most of all, was it right to steal that little girl from her patio? Ethical questions can be asked, blame can be laid, and yet when one observes this ""family"" in action its difficult to protest. Why worry about questions of custody and law when there's hot somen cooking on the stove, freshly-stolen fritos waiting to be chomped, and a giddy, laughing family to embrace?

<i>Shoplifters</i> is about a knowingly transient existence; one whose participants must know it will end disastrously, but which elicits too great a supply of joy, wonder, and content to turn down. In essence, its embrace borders on cynicism--a realization that all lives we potentially pick are bound to end regardless, and that picking one for today which shocks and pleases us in spite of tomorrow is the one to choose above the rest.

The grandmother of this ""family"" may've been--on paper-- a vain criminal; yet she died, with eyes closed, while sitting on a beach and teeming with love--whispering to herself softly ""I know I shall not die alone,"" and she was right. <i>Shoplifters</i> is about nothing more or less than the present. Living solely for it can reap dark and unforeseen consequences, yet its embrace can instill content the likes of which is seldom enjoyed.","japan, hirokazu kore-eda",2018-12-30
2019-01-14,Children of Men,2006,https://boxd.it/BV1Q5,5,Yes,"<b>Seattle Cinerama</b>

Still makes <i>Roma</i> and its hospital/pregnancy sequence look like a cakewalk by comparison.

<i>Children of Men</i> is a film whose power I feared might be ravaged by time--like other then-technically-groundbreaking films of the aughts such as Avatar or Peter Jackson's <i>King Kong</i>; films whose technical achievements have worn into the 2010s and revealed unsavory patina.

Yet 12 years on from its initial release, this still looks better than any of its subsequent mimics and imitators. Even Alejandro Inarritu's undisciplined albeit impressive <i>Birdman</i> one-take is merely a shadow of the heights reached by Cuaron and Lubezki here.

Among <i>Children of Men</i>'s many achievements, the one which resonates with me most is how finely it depicts perspective. Cuaron's one-takes are not simply showmanship as they are later in his filmography, but rather sturdy grounds for world-building from the perspective of <b>one</b> character.

Clive Owen too deserves credit for lending a remarkable center to this film's dizzying amusement-park ride of despair and hopelessness. Imagine his efforts in plausibly remaining the center of a restless camera's orbit through almost every impossibly choreographed scene--and rehearsing them several times over again and again.

Watching the film once more, I'm strongly reminded of Elem Klimov's <i>Come and See</i>; a holocaust film whose despair has less to do with genocide and more to do with Europe's failure to reconcile its history of totalitarianism. Like that devastating film, <i>Children of Men</i> is both an intelligent political commentary and a soul-shaking cinematic experience. Both films also adhere rigorously to a single perspective, therefore allowing a horrid realization--the smallness of those who help from the ground.

With all sociopolitical implications aside, <i>Children of Men</i> is above all a movie about leaving people behind. Theo's friend, Jasper; watched from a hillside as he's disposed of. Honorable midwife Miriam, who’s last seen with a burlap bag being laid over her head. Unexpected savior Marichka, who stays behind in Bexhill to let Theo and Kee's boat exile in safety, and who likely parishes as the city is bombed from the air. One after the other, until our own protagonist--Theo--succumbs to his wound and dies, likely to be left behind forever on the small rowboat with which he saved humanity while Kee is rescued and anchored away. I can imagine his errant body sitting, stooped over in the rowboat, while the tide rocks it about in the fog for all time.

Many films have captured in politics the epoch in which they were released. <i>Casablanca</i> emblazoned America's hope for redemption circa WWII, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> accurately captured a cold-war mileu even enjoyed by intelligence officers who recognized its accuracies, while other films such as <i>The Day After</i> managed to keep world leaders like President Reagan sitting up at night in terror. Yet no other film I can think of has so prodigiously captured a time without falling back upon it like a crutch.

<i>Children of Men</i> is like a compiling of images from its era--from Abu Ghraib, to Guantanamo, to news broadcasts of desperate warfare in urban Iraqi environs, with the emotionally showstopping ""ceasefire"" sequence serving essentially as a culmination of post-9/11 reality and its accompanying ambivalence. Still, it couldn't affect without the sheer power of its images. With both narrative and technique swinging in complete synergy, <i>Children of Men</i> rises above its already-superb individual components and becomes an engrossing, devastating, moving, despairing, unrelenting, hurting, brooding, and hopeful masterpiece.

This is the most relentlessly horrifying and visceral testament to hope I've seen. My worries about its age were ill-founded, and its legacy will likely span not just years, but decades. A sheer, bona fide masterpiece. One of the great films of the 21st century.","masterpiece, cinerama, theatre",2019-01-12
2019-01-20,If Beale Street Could Talk,2018,https://boxd.it/Cjp35,4.5,,"Among <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i>'s many virtues, the most exalting is its vivid affirmation that Barry Jenkins has become one of our great modern filmmakers. A director so confident that he surpasses even his own influences (i.e. John Cassavetes and Wong-Kar Wai specifically) in his persistent mastery of craft. Even Paul Thomas Anderson has reportedly become jealous of Jenkins' astoundingly intimate camerawork.

There are many shots throughout <i>Beale Street</i> which stick with me; Fonny's bloodshot eyes staring through glass with a yellowed brick wall behind him, Tish and Fonny's rain-soaked stroll through Harlem (in which the <i>inside</i> of their bright-red umbrella somehow seems to emit light), and the jib out from under bathtub water during a child's birth. New York as a city is formidably portentious--filmed beautifully and made out to be as gorgeous, but also as threatening and endless a place in Jenkins' film as in any other. There's a reason the score contains hints of Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack for <i>Taxi Driver</i>.

Beneath all this formal brilliance however is James Baldwin's lyrical story-line of racial discrimination whose revealed injustices are so heart-wrenching that it honestly ties knots in my stomach to consider its ubiquity and broader social implications. Like Baldwin himself, Jenkins is a brilliant herald of the african-american experience--able to transcend the undulations of one such turbulent life onto his audience regardless of their racial or social background.

This is a *major* step forward for Jenkins from <i>Moonlight</i> in my opinion. His sophomore film, in spite of its ambition and spots of beauty, was still in every way the effort of a filmmaker seeking foundation. The opening shot of <i>Moonlight</i> for instance (an off-putting tracking shot which stalks about Mahershala Ali and occasionally revolves around his dialogue exchanges) is a transparent example of Jenkins' stylistic uncertainty through that film's making--an uncertainty which has all but disappeared in <i>Beale Street</i>.

Technically and visually, Jenkins refines his vision with this follow-up, and his newly-dictated style is one so thoroughly refreshing and singular among contemporary indie cinema that I'll rue the entire industry should he be unable to produce features following this one (most great modern directors seem to run to television before fully exploring cinema). <i>Beale Street</i>, like all great films, deserves a cinema--and cinema.. in its now-beleaguered and crippled state, deserves Barry Jenkins.",,2019-01-19
2019-01-24,The Congress,2013,https://boxd.it/CvKjd,4,Yes,"Hadn't seen this since Siff 2014--and wow. On a par with <i>Mr. Nobody</i> as far as insanely ambitious yet ultimately muddled contemporary sci-fi goes.

Stanislaw Lem's original novel is a far superior beast in its tonal consistency, but Ari Folman's film deserves credit for plowing through its own insane grey matter with a ferocity almost nonexistent amidst modern film, arthouse or not. Also, Harvey Keitel plays a character named ""Al,"" and elevates the film by just being there as his most gum-chewing-kid-from-the-bronx self.

Nevertheless, Folman's transposing of the modern entertainment business onto Lem's original story is sort of... predictable, and the film's early live-action scenes are sloppily staged and stodgy. Although I suppose with 5-6 years' hindsight, the film's prophecy of uncanny valley-like computer simulations of actors has proved weirdly prescient (e.g. Peter Cushing in <i>Rogue One</i>, Paul Walker in <i>Furious 7</i>, etc.), which certainly means Folman is deserving of some ex post facto applause.",better than you think,2019-01-23
2019-03-04,The Master,2012,https://boxd.it/EIt45,4.5,Yes,"<i>""If you figure a way to live without serving a master, any master, then let the rest of us know, will you? For you'd be the first person in the history of the world.”</i>

For 7 years I mulled this over and I still don't get it. Paul Thomas Anderson's films are usually obtuse, but <i>The Master</i> can't even be measured with a protractor. It reaches around itself 360 degrees, then circles back twice the other way.

Roger Ebert famously wrote of the film in a 2 1/2-out-of-4 star review, ""when I reach for it, my hand closes on air."" I shared the same sentiment upon first blush in 2012. It's performances were mesmeric, storytelling graceful, and cinematography indelible, gorgeous--70mm beauty. Yet at its end I threw up my arms in utter defeat and shrugged. I saw it twice that fall--I remember both viewings. 1st at Seattle Cinerama in 70mm, 2nd at the Crest Cinema. Neither helped the other.

I was struck at the time most by Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Having come off a 4-year hiatus from acting due to <i>I'm Still Here</i> and its requisite craziness, his appearance in <i>The Master</i> seemed gargantuan and utterly transformative--like a rabid primate unleashed upon post-war America. But I'm drawn now to Philip Seymour Hoffman's work, perhaps in light of his death. Lancaster Dodd is a tangible, Orson Welles-like presence, whose charlatanism demands a kind of dual performance. By day, a charming purveyor of ""The Cause,"" by night, an embittered opportunist tooled by his wife. The jail cell sequence in particular features a notable, impulsive transition from Dodd blaming ""past lives"" for Quell's woes to ""laziness"" in a scene which apparently reveals his knowing con and lack of integrity.

Why do these two characters connect? Each belongs, one would think, to a completely different film. Paul Thomas Anderson thinks otherwise. My predominant reservation with the film upon release was this divide between two characters and two worlds; two films. <i>The Master</i>'s opening 15 minutes are staggering. Freddie Quell's madness and aimlessness dominates, invoking a style reminiscent of Alain Resnais's filmography which mysteriously disappears for the remainder of the film. Once Quell stumbles upon that fated yacht in San Francisco harbor, one film ends and another begins.

Yet there are scenes of inimitable power. Freddie hollowing a sand doll's makeshift genitals. The mad-dash from a cabbage field. Dodd and Quell's jail cell confrontation. The salt-flat motorcycle ride which simultaneously honors Freddie Young's 70mm photography of <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> while paying tribute to <i>Melvin and Howard</i>. Most incredibly, the ""processing"" sequence between Dodd and Quell, which sweeps all hitherto cited moments into a trench and crushes them beneath its feet. So many masterful sequences in search of a plot or through-line which never arrives.

<i>The Master</i> is scattershot--that I can't deny; that I felt more than anything else on first viewing, and that I continue to feel. As poetic and lush as most of <i>The Master</i> is, there remains a moment where Joaquin Phoenix sits across from Rami Malek and says with steadfast earnestness, ""I want to fart in your face."" Yes, ""I want to fart in your face."" Is it intelligent or juvenile to seek ""answers"" from a film which, however complex, features a line such as ""I want to fart in your face”? That's not a criticism, but a valid question.

There are no easy answers in <i>The Master</i>, but I suppose like most great art, definitive answers are not the intent. Does the film work in spite of its meanderings, or because of them? Perhaps the latter.

<i>The Master</i> is among the best films I've ever seen. Maybe. It's something. What is it? I don't know. But I suppose that's the point. My hand closes on air.",???,2019-03-03
2019-03-17,Last Year at Marienbad,1961,https://boxd.it/FnNYf,5,Yes,"Belongs to the category of film whose story is nonexistent and whose purpose is obscure. Is it to entertain? To provoke? To ennoble arthouse film-goers with its time loops, repetitions, protracted monologues and vacant stares?

I don't know, but I don't particularly care. It's easy to despise <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> if only because it seems to most folks... pointless. Why watch a movie with no meaning? To this I reply: 'why watch <i>Star Wars</i>?' Many find the latter spectacularly entertaining, and excuse its utter frivolity because of that. <i>Marienbad</i> is the same for me--a film with no meaning which invariably stirs within me deep and latent emotion.

Roger Ebert detailed in several articles his experience of first seeing <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> in 1961. He queued outside a theatre close to University of Illinois and eagerly awaited entry. 15 minutes prior to showtime, a crowd exiting from the previous screening strode past him with palms to their temples, shaking their heads; ""what was that about?"" Roger waited for entry, and then, as he wrote, ""it was our turn to go in and be mystified.""

<i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> inspires just that sort of fun. A giddy, childlike exaltation. It's an experiment with cinema which dazzles by dint of its singularity. Alain Resnais was able to nudge the form and shatter convention without discarding those cosmetics and artifices which make cinema beautiful. Jean-Luc Godard's notion of exploding cinema was to hand-hold the camera, chop up his scenes, and make up as he went along.

Resnais thought differently. He shoots in cinemascope; 2.35:1 and anamorphic. His film teems with dolly shots, baroque architecture, genteel camera movements, and artifice, artifice, artifice. Yet these conventions don't impinge upon its gonzo nature in the slightest. It's the very opposite of Guido's film in <i>8 1/2</i>; a film with all the advantages of avant-garde cinema without any of the drawbacks.

Like <i>Citizen Kane</i>, or <i>2001</i>, or <i>Battleship Potemkin</i>, <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> succeeds in advancing the film form, uncovering new and effective ways of mesmerizing its audience. It instills an intoxicating atmosphere like nothing else you'll see.

Watching <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i> resembles sitting in a spaceship far from everything you've known where time is non-functioning and string quartets play like pipe organs. It's a dream which lasts only through its final shot, and is unlike anything else in cinematic history.

2019-04-16,The Great Dictator,1940,https://boxd.it/GPKYr,5,Yes,"Weird, when one considers the iconic comedian Charlie Chaplin's films to be comedies, because from <i>City Lights</i> onward each was dominated by melancholy, poverty, fascism, and in the case of <i>Monsieur Verdoux</i>, his most disturbing and blatantly anti-capitalist film, outright murder.

What was eating him? Did he continue to be haunted by a childhood of indigence? Why was social and political injustice so often on the mind of this gifted silent comedian? One realizes quickly when reviewing his filmography that in almost every film he made poverty is front and center; even his iconic character The Tramp--once said to be the most famous single image in western culture--is an archetype of homelessness (Tramp is a synonym for Vagrant of course).

In Chaplin's <i>The Great Dictator</i>, his first genuine talkie, the Hollywood star works his craft until he can no more, and in a famous closing sequence finally relinquishes all comic pretense. He speaks of peace and democracy and calls for equality of all persons, ""jew or gentile, black or white.""

Such a speech is not seriously conducive to political reform or human rights progress, but it is, in my optimistic eyes, an attempt to start. To clear that initial hurdle; to inspire. It is moving and daring in a way that few films in history can claim to be. That Chaplin's popularity would wane and status as a US citizen be revoked as an indirect consequence of this political expression was inevitable. Quite frankly, many at the time perceived it as communist rhetoric, hence Chaplin's eventual difficulties with the press and the house un-american activities committee.

I admire this film's political conviction, yet to wildly enjoy the film, I don't have to. Apart from the film's political text, it contains some of Chaplin's most brilliant comedy. The opening sequence recalls his 1918 WWI parody <i>Shoulder Arms</i>; it's highlight is a sequence in which an untriggered explosive follows Chaplin as he circles the battlefield.

Another sequence has Chaplin, as 'Adenoid Hynkel,' the eponymous dictator who obviously parallels Adolf Hitler, dancing a ballet with the globe in his office--at one point throttling it with his rear while straddling a desk. Yet another genius sequence has Chaplin, this time in the role of a jewish barber, serving his client to the rhythm of Brahms' Hungarian Dance No.5--a moment of such inspired comedy that it was eventually impersonated and immortalized by Chuck Jones' ""Rabbit of Seville"" cartoon in 1950.

<i>The Great Dictator</i> is wall-to-wall with that signature comedic brilliance of Chaplin, yet its humor is so deepened by a sincere and at the time subversive satirical edge. The image of Chaplin's ""Hynkel,"" for example, frustratingly and comically peeling a banana while fuming over betrayal is a slight to Hitler more effective than any oration or drawn caricature could possibly be, and it is so while being unutterably hilarious.

Perhaps most melancholic about the film however is that, in spite of its biting satire and at times dramatic depiction of a third reich analog, the true depths of Nazi depravity could not have been known during production by Chaplin or indeed by the rest of the world. This means sequences of storm-troopers marching the streets of a 'Tomanian' ghetto and overturning trash cans appears inevitably quaint when compared with what is now known about the real tragedies of Nazi-occupied cities.

One has to accept while watching <i>The Great Dictator</i> that the world of the film is a sort of storybook portrait of nazi germany, but not one done intentionally, and that Chaplin couldn't have realized this at the time is, to me, one of the most haunting aspects of the film--the simple realization that they couldn't have known. They couldn't have known.

<i>The Great Dictator</i> is Chaplin's masterpiece, and the paramount work of his filmography. That the ending sequence involves his iconic barber/tramp character--a staple of silent film--being asked, begged, to finally 'speak,' or else have 'all hope be lost,' is an on-screen admission of guilt; of <i>literal</i> silence in the face of terror. 'I have been silent for too long,' he finally admits, as many others at the time should've. Speak. Speak. Or else all hope is lost.","masterpiece, criterion channel",2019-04-15
2019-04-26,Under the Silver Lake,2018,https://boxd.it/Hjomv,4.5,,"I march with the rest in saying A24's failure to release this theatrically is their biggest blunder. It doesn't do justice to David Robert Mitchell, his cinematographer, sound designer, or the film community at large. <i>Under the Silver Lake</i> is the most seriously *cinematic* film I've seen in quite some time, and it deserved at least a serviceable art-house distribution. It's a rare mistake on behalf of a typically adventurous commercial distributor.

Nevertheless, after much, much, much delay, <i>Under the Silver Lake</i> is now (legally) available in the states, and it impressively has after much anticipation managed to surpass my expectations. I'm too gobsmacked upon first viewing to adequately discuss its thematic territory, but suffice to say that its filmmaker's constantly evident talent is enough to clarify its greatness in my mind. Also, it is NOT <i>Southland Tales</i>; please disregard any such comparison. This is its own wild existential musing on L.A, yes, but one which hangs together as well as <i>Mulholland Drive</i> or <i>The Long Goodbye</i>.

One knows when they're witnessing the exercise of a skilled director. Regardless of how hard to digest you find Mitchell's heady thematic explorations, his breakneck execution of each scene creates an irresistible, rhythmic pace at which the audience can sprint ahead through the mania and hallucinogenic fervor of Sam's wild odyssey. It's headlong yet meandering and always unbelievably engaging, and proves one of the more mesmerizing films I've seen this decade.

I firmly believe that had A24 screened this at Sundance or SXSW instead of Cannes and leapt at its original June 22nd release date that it would've found an audience. This is a thrillingly ambitious work from a talented filmmaker with lots on his mind. Its one of the most bizarre and multifaceted films I've seen in years, and it deserves to find its audience.

P.S. The ending, so often called 'anticlimactic,' is what makes the film in my mind; it clarifies Mitchell's intent to not only entertain but to remind his audience of a perceived 'millennial ennui.' It renders the protagonist's antics as desperate escapism rather than intrigue, indicating a failed quest for existential significance which is, in Mitchell's mind, endemic to the current generation. Whether you agree with the director's sentiment or not is up to you, but that and the ending's lack of resolution doesn't diminish its thematic importance.",,2019-04-25
2019-05-08,Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,1964,https://boxd.it/HSsRx,5,Yes,"I've never written of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> on Letterboxd, and not for lack of praise but for lack of original insight. <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> has become, more than 50 years since its release, a satire as firmly situated in the annals of literary history as Gulliver's Travels or Lysistrata. It captures its epoch with an intelligence and wit simply unsurpassed by football field lengths stacked atop each other. 

A recent viewing of Adam McKay's underwhelming <i>Vice</i> reminded and further cemented in my mind the timeless genius of Kubrick's film. Unlike McKay's film, Kubrick knows precisely and exactly at every moment what he wishes to convey. 

Each character is an archetype jabbing at not only the Strategic Air Command of the 1960s but at infrastructures of power throughout history. The mad major Jack D. Ripper, the well-intentioned but impish captain Mandrake, the farcical George C. Scott as SAC Command and Control consultant to the president, who whilst straddling a book titled 'World Targets in Megadeaths' is able to deliver one of the greatest comic performances of all time. That juxtaposition alone should provide insight into this film's paradoxical brilliance.

Also unlike McKay's film is <i>Strangelove</i>'s shocking simplicity, which emerges only after dozens of viewings. The movie cuts between only 3 sets throughout the majority of its length, with its cast principally unchanging. Its a spartan presentation that skimps on extraneous detail and through its slim 94-minute runtime contains not 1 ounce of fat--scratch that--not 1 *gram*. <i>Vice</i>, on the other hand, skips through time like it were a clumsy jack rabbit, capturing any moment the editor deemed necessary to propel its turgid length through to its equally facile conclusion.

<i>Dr. Strangelove</i> is not bogged down in anything unnecessary--its making is like Kubrick's greatest chess match, where not a single misstep in its craft or production was made. It's a film which is flawless. <i>Flawless</i>. It will last for centuries--perhaps as long as humans are still consuming artistic works. Kubrick was a kid from the Bronx, yet he made films of such staggering genius that time will render him immortal, as if he were one of the great sages of our time.

2019-06-18,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,2004,https://boxd.it/JS6R9,3.5,Yes,"The most dream-like film in Wes Anderson's filmography--like a pastel-coated melodrama set atop a convoluted toy boat. I've no idea what to make of it.

<i>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</i> contains bizarre scenes, environments, and characters streaming toward you constantly and on occasion they even appear to make complete sense. These moments are briefly lived.

There's a scene in which Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson each speak to each other on a night-lit pier through such obviously constructed, comical german and american-southern accents yet also do so with such tender sincerity and adherence to the emotions of their characters that one wonders what sort of schizophrenia the corduroy-dressed auteur must've been afflicted with when he conceptualized it and the entire film.

Roger Ebert said in his review: ""Wes Anderson's ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is the damnedest film. I can't recommend it, but I would not for one second discourage you from seeing it."" I agree.

I can't decide whether this is Wes Anderson's best film or his worst. I suppose it doesn't matter though. It's something. Isn't that enough? What do you think?

2019-06-24,Network,1976,https://boxd.it/Kb08F,5,Yes,"Is there any performance in cinema greater than Peter Finch's in Network? Sweat pours down his brow; arms flinging, trench-coat flap waving as he tightens his hands and yells -- <i>""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!""</i> Indeed, Howard Beale. Indeed.

<i>Network</i> is Sidney Lumet's crowning achievement, and one of the greatest satires ever committed to film, second only to <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> I'm willing to say. This masterwork is radical and revolutionary in a way which contemporary Hollywood conventions wouldn't even allow. Permitted, films such as the critically maligned <i>Roman J. Israel, Esq.</i> still are able to maturely comment upon modern proletariat plights--yet no other film since <i>Network</i> has done the same with such sharp vinegar, and such unsentimental wit.

Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, William Holden, Peter Finch--need I say more? This cast was born to shout in the same room. Each person contributes unequivocally to <i>Network</i>'s flinging, ecstatic dynamism. It's a dialogue-heavy bonanza which inevitably exhilarates as much as a James Bond-Jason Bourne-thrill ride. When William Holden shouts into the phone a line as iconic as ""he's saying life is bullshit and it is, so what're you screaming about?"" it's difficult not to jump and smile as if a light just passed through you. That's really the level of exaltation I'm talking about.

Yet it's derived from a place of such cynicism. Paddy Chayefsky's superb, brilliant, unorthodox script is among the great works of pessimistic american literature; as damning a portrait of private capital, corporate greed (that's putting it simplistically), and free enterprise as any I've ever seen. Ned Beatty's farcical, president taft-like, yet also utterly terrifying corporate chairman of CCA (Arthur Jensen) is one of the great depictions of proto-Rockefeller american-industrial insanity this side of Daniel Plainview. His explanation of 'corporate cosmology' is one of the great, politically radical moments of american cinema.

Depressing how right Howard Beale was, huh? He began as a televangelist for left-wing, proletariat empowerment, and ended as a mouth-piece for corporate cynicism and defeat.

One looks at Howard Beale and wonders; ""how long will the Parkland activists really care about gun rights before joining a business or conglomerate, or becoming journalists concerned primarily with placating readers and receiving paychecks? How long can the yellow-vests in France picket for union rights before retiring to their families and hearth and carrying on exactly as they were before?"" Even Jerry Rubin--who once marched through the streets of Chicago carrying a Pig in his arms to protest the 1968 democratic national convention--eventually gave way into entrepreneurship; ""wealth creation is the <i>real</i> American revolution,"" Rubin once claimed in post-Vietnam War America. Arthur Jensen would agree.

<i>Network</i> is thrilling, unadulterated genius. Its stature in American cinema should be as great as <i>The Godfather</i>'s. As a matter of fact, I think it's greater than <i>The Godfather</i>. It's an unabashed condemnation of everything that's kitsch and profitable. It's as true as as a movie can be without being unbearable. Where else was Howard Beale to end up in the end..? except laying there on the floor, dead, spattered with blood.. because of poor ratings.",masterpiece,2019-06-24
2019-07-06,My Fair Lady,1964,https://boxd.it/KLnoj,4,,"Two ways to take this--as a) a butchering of George Bernard Shaw's original, borderline feminist-progressive play, or b) an unusually intelligent, refreshingly unsentimental movie musical for its period. I seem to fall into the latter camp. Fussing over this film's sanitizing of Shaw or its softened ending (carried over from the original musical production) is trivial when juxtaposed against its sheer fun.

Albeit, a few troubles muddy the proceedings. Marni Nixon's voice emerging from Audrey Hepburn's lips during the musical numbers is always slightly irksome as it’s a solemn reminder that Julie Andrews likely would've been a superior lead for the film, as she, of course, originated the role on Broadway and did so very successfully whilst singing in her own voice. Then again, Hepburn is Hepburn--she makes every instant she's on-screen radiant and appealing.

What's not in question however is the film's technical proficiency. Shot on Super Panavision 70mm film, <i>My Fair Lady</i> stands with <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> and <i>How the West Was Won</i> as a firm reminder of how superb large-format film was and is, and how its employment during the 1960s in Hollywood signals that period as being in a way the peak of <i>Old</i> Hollywood before it died and birthed <i>New</i> Hollywood (i.e. <i>Easy Rider</i> and <i>The Godfather</i> onwards).

In spite of their many constraints, Old Hollywood films were peak escapism. In a way, the staid photography, casual cutting patterns, and lack of experimentation was refinement, not banality. Cinema today is, by comparison, too shambolic, too hand-held--inarticulacy rules the dialogue, disorder suits its cinematography. Impressive sets, costumes, and optical effects have given way to CGI mockeries. If modern blockbusters looked like <i>My Fair Lady</i>, we might be in good shape, at least in terms of craft and technical prowess.

I should clarify; I mentioned earlier <i>My Fair Lady</i>'s being ""unsentimental,"" which may seem shocking to some who consider it a romantic musical. What I admire most about <i>My Fair Lady</i>, whilst disregarding its superlative performances, music, and production design, is its surprising retaining of <i>Pygmalion</i>'s harsh subtext. Yes, the ending is a disappointment and abandonment of the story's conviction, but by and large this remains firm in depicting Henry Higgins' unabashed misogyny and Eliza Doolittle's ultimate empowerment.

But then, it was Old Hollywood, and I return to the conflict mentioned at the outset of this review: do I admire what's there or despair what's not? <i>My Fair Lady</i> becomes close to sincere for a glitzy, big-budget Hollywood blockbuster of 1964. For that, and its marvelous production value, I'm able to forgive its mistakes. I enjoy it too damn much not to.",better than you think,2019-07-06
2019-07-24,Two for the Road,1967,https://boxd.it/LHqTZ,4.5,,"Plays with time in much the same way <i>Last Year at Marienbad<i> did, but with more purpose and a clearer aim. Stanley Donen's Nouvelle Vague-influenced <i>Two for the Road<i> is not only indebted to Resnais, Godard, and Truffaut in style but also in content. It's a romance whose center is as complex as <i>Jules and Jim<i>'s or <i>Before Midnight<i>'s and just as believable.

1967 was a bridge year in Hollywood--the same year that popular, progressive films such as <i>Bonnie and Clyde<i> and <i>The Graduate<i> were playing alongside <i>Doctor Doolittle<i>. Needless to say, it was pure schizophrenia in the industry. <i>Two for the Road<i> is wonderful not only for its truthful and shockingly modern portrait of marriage between two people, but also for its equally impressive marriage of 'old' and 'new' Hollywood conventions. In many ways it's a classical Hollywood romance and road movie, yet also it's avant-garde, mature, and unexpectedly poignant.

Interesting how upon first watching <i>Annie Hall<i>, I'd suspected that <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind<i>'s out-of-order romance had been inspired by that 1977 film. Yet now after watching Donen's film, I'm of course wondering if <i>Annie Hall<i>'s structure might've been inspired by <i>Two for the Road<i>'s. It seems this novel filmic structure for romance-chronicling cinema has existed longer than I thought. How much farther back does it reach? Griffith? 

It's as if filmmakers have always used their medium to tell love stories out of order, perhaps because that's the only way such affairs can be remembered--whichever way makes them warmest. There's the good moments, the bad moments, and the moments which seem so much better because of the bad. Only when looking at them all at once do we understand them most.

NOTE: This film was written entirely by <i>Eyes Wide Shut<i> co-writer Frederic Raphael, and I can't help but wonder if Kubrick saw this, admired it, and consequently hired Raphael. Both films are about the complexity of marriage and fidelity in intelligent, perceptive ways. Charting the two's relation is a fascinating endeavor that enriches both works.",,2019-07-24

This is a good indication of how scarcely great films arise from the 500 million dollar-plus arena of blockbusters. Most are facile entertainment (e.g. Fast and Furious films), or amiable but formulaic IPs (Marvel, Star Wars, et al). Only these two exceptions emerge: Pixar and Christopher Nolan. For the latter, <i>Inception</i> is a pinnacle.

What film of the past decade has both influenced popular culture so much as to have entered the vocabulary (<a href=""https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=17573)"">neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=17573)</a> whilst also being an 160-million dollar cinematic tour-de-force at a major studio's expense? None except Mr. Nolan could've conceived of such a dizzying rapt of dreams within dreams, of heist mechanics overlapping with the machinations of the mind, and an ending so ingenious that it's ambiguity has caused simultaneous guffaws, gasps, and applause for years after its release.

There seldom are films as prolific and great as <i>Inception</i>. It's continued success and adoration is a testament to the drought of originality in big-budget filmmaking and the thirst by mass audiences for non-IP event films which is only satiated once every 2 or 3 years when big-budget auteurs such as Nolan, Scorsese, Tarantino, or Ang Lee decide to turn out and give us something wonderful and new to chew on in a multiplex.","masterpiece, cinerama, theatre",2019-08-03
2019-09-03,Before Sunset,2004,https://boxd.it/NPXnL,5,Yes,"Initially I saw this as the weakest of Linklater's <i>'Before'</i> trilogy, but after re-watch, I'm suspecting it's the best. Perhaps because this is the least <i>overtly</i> romantic of the 3--as it's an in-between chapter where the characters haven't quite decided where they're going or who they want to be yet (early 30s in a nutshell, I imagine)--I was initially turned off by it. That reticence though grows more tantalizing with each re-watch.

<i>Before Sunset</i> captures that allusive, seductive mystique of will-she-won't-she romantic dynamism that we've all experienced. These two characters, Jesse and Celine, are so clearly attracted to one another yet won't admit it, and that reticence permeates the entire film. There are no declarations of love, no sweeping romantic climaxes of kissing and love-making... Nothing. Just lots of talk <i>hinting</i> at that love, and some Nina Simone songs as well (her lyrics clearly substituting for the characters' verbal admissions).

Weirdly, their romance would almost be spoiled by such admittance; that enigmatic, subtle mystique would falter. It exists instead in the form of slight gestures: Celine reaching for Jesse's head without him noticing, Jesse repeatedly delaying his airport-departure, not to mention the exquisite glances the two share whilst ascending the staircase to Celine's apartment, a moment of shocking but quiet power which recalls the music booth scene from <i>'Before Sunrise.'</i>

It's awe-inspiring how Linklater seems to run the gamut of romantic love and its complete dimensions through the course of these 3 simple, undiluted films which consist of nothing but talk and raw person-to-person connection. Somehow, by reducing these two people's lives to nothing but the most essential moments they share together without anything else depicted (no flashbacks, major developments, or events are shown), he's able to convey an existential ennui by it's end as intense as in the end of <i>'Synecdoche, New York</i>.'

I'd always thought <i>'Before Midnight'</i> was the apex of the trilogy, as it climaxes a brilliant series of movies with a small yet apocalyptic and cruelly realistic argument that threatens everything established before it. I still think it's genius, but <i>Before Sunset</i> is more intriguing and haunting maybe because it's less explicit. That tantalizing uncertainty both characters feel is so palpable and so erotic, but also so sad and frustrating and confusing.

The face Celine makes when admitting she could've been spotted by Jesse on his wedding day is painful, and it's one I'm sure many have seen before in their own lives. That eerie adherence to real-life is what allows the <i>'Before Trilogy</i>' to catapult itself out of the realm of fiction and into reality. Every inch of these movies feels completely real for it's audience, and that makes it one of the great movie trilogies ever conceived.

It's been quoted so many times on this site, yet I have to quote it once more as it's one of the greatest closing lines of all time:

Have thought about this for the last couple days since watching it. Bi Gan's follow up to <i>Kaili Blues</i> is maddening--even boring--and by turns mesmerizing. 

Despite its glacial pace and hazy (deliberately so) storytelling, its final hour-long, bravura long-take is such a sweeping and persuasive case for the film's greatness that I'm at a loss for words. If one watches passively and yearns for conventional narrative, they find nothing. Alternatively, if one watches with an eye for thematic repetition, and recognizes without question that the film's final hour is, in fact, a brilliantly constructed dream-sequence, then <i>Journey's </i>poignancy reveals itself.

Like <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, or even <i>In the Mood for Love</i>, <i>Long Day’s Journey Into Night</i> captures longing and melancholy in a way few films do. The protagonist's waking life is marred by a slowness and malaise reserved for Andrei Tarkovsky films, while his dream-state is--interestingly enough--accelerated, redemptive, and hyper-real. 

<i>Journey</i> shows us a man whose life has deteriorated such that only in his dreams can his wrongs be vindicated; he can play ping-pong with his unborn child, rescue his mother-figure from perdition, and reunite with his long-lost lover.

Is this a consequence of it kicking off my Covid-19 self-isolation? Perhaps. Or is it because--despite my cynical reserve--the film stirs in me genuine emotion derived not solely from its juvenile love story, but from its broader implications about Japan's history as a battering ram for the ring of fire?

I initially recoiled from what I perceived as adolescent, male wish-fulfillment (strapping young man rescues damsel he loves), only to discover upon re-watch wish fulfillment of a very different sort. What if Japan's Shinto-Buddhist traditions could avert disaster? It seems trivial on first blush, but this notion haunts the film more seriously than its cosmic love story.

Pairing this mature concept with a twisty plot and characteristically Shinkai/Wong-Kar Wai-esque distant love story produces a film so soaringly original, endlessly re-watchable, and staggeringly beautiful that it obliterates any petty complaints one might have denoting plot contrivances or sophomoric sentimentality. 

It's possible as I slowly retreat back to everyday civilization that this piece of escapist entertainment will seem less profound, but <i>Your Name.</i> nevertheless, despite its failings, is a spellbinding work and one of the great popular films of its time.

NOTE: [roughly translated; excerpted from an interview on the American Blu-Ray release]

Shinkai: ""An inspiration for the film was a Haruki Murakami story I read called <i>'On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning.'</i> In the story, a man crushes on a woman he sees in Harajuku, and imagines seducing her by lying that they met when they were kids and had fallen in love, but had both contracted amnesia and forgotten one another.

Despite six decades elapsing since this film’s premiere, its portrait of female frustrations and despair seems timeless, and despite the Japanese setting, its message is universal.

In times of political turmoil, should one continue with their profession ignorant of its consequences, focusing on the work and disregarding its consequences? 

If not, what’s the alternative? Isn’t someone always tacitly supporting a country or economy—and by extension a political ideology—in their daily routine even if they’re not conscious of it? 

Is it even possible to live a “moral” life without withdrawing from civilization entirely?

2020-08-23,All About Lily Chou-Chou,2001,https://boxd.it/1jCRBp,4.5,Yes,"Still not sure how to review this movie. I've updated the rating to a 4 1/2 but probably that's inappropriate given I neither enjoy it nor recommend it. 

First time through, I wasn't sure I liked the digital photography (it was shot on an early Sony CineAlta, one of the first industry-ready digital replacements for 35mm), but seeing it again I understand why Iwai went for the then-underdeveloped medium, as it makes an already discomfiting subject even more eerie and compressed.

That and the soundtrack by ""Lily Chou-Chou"" really convey the then-newness of the 21st century, and that newness being paired with the shocking sadism of the children illuminates what I guess is Iwai's critique of modern coming-of-age. But then a critique of what? Does this film really do anything except assault its audience? 

It doesn't seem made with any goal in mind; certainly it's not to entertain, nor to recoup its budget, which probably came mostly from arts commissions and industry friends of the director looking for some cash to burn on a prestige festival darling. Is it to punish arthouse moviegoers? It's as if the director is wagging his finger at his own audience; ""go back to the multiplex,"" he says grievously.

When I first finished watching <i>All About Lily Chou Chou</i>, my immediate thought was this: ""can anybody outside the niche of cinephilia bear to watch this?"" I think not. It's too busy, too painful, too experimental; a 2 and a half hour misery-porn-bildungsroman whose plot is out of order and whose middle stretch is shot entirely on MiniDV tape. So what's your guess on the box-office? Final gross over a billion?

Despite my misgivings (of which I have many) with this film, I have rated it a 4 1/2. Why? Because--despite its problems--this is one of the most emotionally overwhelming movies I've ever seen, and one of the most lyrical. I've only seen it for the first time 2 months ago, but images and scenes from this film I'm sure will stick with me for years. 

It's also more a compliment to the film than an insult to say I can't review it. Great films don't need lots of elaboration, and why should they? Everything it has to say is up there on the screen; what can petty words do in articulating the ineffable?","japan, kanopy, shunji iwai",2020-08-23

2020-09-11,Tenet,2020,https://boxd.it/1lEaNJ,3,,"<i>Tenet </i>is a landmark in cinematic history. Why? Because it proves Christopher Nolan can blunder.

For the first time, Nolan's tricks stop being amazing and simply become tedious. Unlike <i>Inception--</i>still a masterpiece in my opinion--<i>Tenet</i>'s central conceit never seems plausible or intriguing, failing in the very first scene it's introduced to excuse it's blatantly paradoxical nature.

The film's gorgeously shot and very watchable, but it becomes tiring hardly understanding from scene-to-scene what our characters are trying to accomplish and why (otherwise known as ""The Bond-movie problem"" in my lexicon).

Christopher Nolan is one of our great directors, trying with every film--including this one--to produce a masterpiece. But whereas <i>Dunkirk,</i> <i>Inception, and Memento </i>excel<i> </i>in crafting accessible, spectacular puzzle-boxes, this one becomes lost in the maze.

More than anything else, watching <i>Tenet</i> gave me a heightened appreciation for <i>Inception, </i>it's closest cinematic companion. The latter is a film whose potentially confusing, intricately planned 3rd-act dream-heist is so meticulously edited and arranged that every move and gesture by our characters is clearly understood, working to brilliant and thrilling effect.

Many have accused Nolan of producing cold, unfeeling movies, but watching <i>Inception</i> recently, I literally felt tears welling up in my eyes at points because of the sheer awesomeness of it's spectacle and ambition. That is a great movie, which I knew back when I saw it in 2010, but which with the hindsight of 10 years has now somehow become even greater. <i>Tenet </i>is not great, it's merely passing.","bullock imax, theatre, christopher nolan",2020-09-11

I love the documentary aspect of this film. Every faux interview is conducted so sparingly and with such understatement that an almost uncanny realism is achieved; ditto for the scenes depicting film production.

Kore-eda Hirokazu belongs in a category with directors like Edward Yang and Yasujiro Ozu who with each film address mundane but profound aspects of life without resorting to Hollywood melodrama, and who pitch their action at a meditative rather than breakneck pace.

<i>After Life</i> distinguishes itself in this category as perhaps the most achingly poignant film I've seen; more so even than <i>Yi Yi</i> or <i>Tokyo Story</i>.

I'd also be lying if I said I for one second believed that any of the characters were real, fleshed-out humans and not totems representing aspects of director Hideaki Anno's psyche.

<i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i> is apparently regarded as a major artistic achievement in some circles, but it seems too immersed in otaku solipsism to ever appeal to mainstream audiences (I include myself in that category).

2020-10-28,Howl's Moving Castle,2004,https://boxd.it/1qGzAf,3,Yes,"To this day, <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> remains in my mind the black sheep of Hayao Miyazaki's filmography.

It contains some of his best images (the lumbering steampunk castle, Howl catching a falling star), but its story is frustratingly besotted with diversions, and the characters--unlike in every other Miyazaki film--remain ciphers to the end and don't penetrate our hearts and minds (I'd be astonished if there were as many Howl and Sophie cosplayers out there as there are Nausicaa's or Kiki's).

His two preceding films, <i>Princess Mononoke</i> and the undisputed masterpiece <i>Spirited Away</i>, were similarly ambitious but maintained tightly constructed premises. <i>Spirited Away</i> arguably has the least plot of any late-period Miyazaki film, but compensates by dint of its simplicity (coming-of-age arc), while <i>Mononoke</i> contains a politically-charged, action-oriented plot so masterfully constructed its screenplay belongs on a shelf beside War and Peace.

<i>Howl</i> on the other hand vacillates between WWII allegory, fantasy adventure, and romantic drama; an uneasy combination to be sure. That <i>Howl</i> yields an aggregate 4.2 on Letterboxd (and climbing) whilst other Miyazaki works such as <i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i> and <i>Nausicaa</i> trail behind at 4.1 and 4.0 respectively is curious to me. Nevertheless, that castle sure is something isn't it.","japan, anime, hayao miyazaki",2020-10-28

2020-11-12,Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion,1997,https://boxd.it/1scfU3,,,"Posting a more fleshed-out review to this since I can't shirk its impact 1 month later (reviews are an exorcism of sorts). <i>The End of Evangelion<i> is baffling by design; I'm completely at a loss to its meaning as a stand-alone piece of art and as a conclusion to <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion<i>.

Its plot, as with the anime it concludes, is questionable in its plausibility but rich with Freudian and psychoanalytic subtext. It's also a meaningful allegory for otaku solipsism and the hikikimori phenomena in Japan, which is unfortunately a serious dilemma in the ultra-modern country. 

Hideaki Anno, the show's creator, has said his series is intended solely for those people--mostly young and Japanese--whom are dangerously withdrawn from civilization, and that well-adjusted individuals need not apply. If <i>Evangelion<i> can do this, diagnose its audience's mental health, then I must rank myself among the latter category of person.

I've personally no need for an anime to tell me not to watch anime--for someone like myself this is a moot point. Nevertheless, <i>Evangelion<i> the show and this film provoke a strange fascination in me. It's a series which has supposedly raked in over a billion dollars in revenue (US$), has spawned numerous video games, plushies, vinyl Pop figures, and spin-off films whilst also gathering enough prestige to be ranked in a poll hosted by Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs as the No. 1 Japanese animation in history (surpassing <i>Spirited Away<i> and <i>Akira<i>)[*1].

Yet, despite this, and despite its many conventional mech action sequences, it's ultimately and unabashedly an auteurist work which belongs in the arthouse. For example, one simply doesn't expect a spin-off film of a hit animated series geared predominantly at pre-teens to start with its protagonist ejaculating into his palm, graphically so, cursing himself whilst he does. Nor does one expect that film to, however much it was hinted at in the TV show on which it's based, go-for-broke with a 20-minute closing screed against the audience's own solipsism. 

A multimedia franchise *this* idiosyncratic and experimental is unprecedented in popular culture; <i>Twin Peaks<i> is the closest comparison, but then <i>Twin Peaks<i> has not inspired Playstation 2 video games, pachinko machines[*2], and an amusement park attraction[*3].

All of this is to say nothing of <i>The End of Evangelion<i> as a cinematic experience, which rivals <i>2001<i> and parts of the recent <i>Twin Peaks<i> revival in its acid-trip obscurity. Anno, like David Lynch, is able to visualize his existential yearnings in a spectacular, cinematic fashion which is, in its own way, irresistibly poetic.

Still, it's a peculiar object to behold. A film supposedly intended to conclude the TV show from which it's spun-off but which is blatantly allegorical, surreal, absurd, gross, and arguably inappropriate for the audience the show was aimed at. 

That Anno's financiers permitted a film so avant-garde to be released is truly astonishing. That a series aimed squarely at critiquing its audience is able to find one is amazing. That action figures for protagonist Shinji Ikari, a whiny, unlikable, perverted worry-wart, sell like hotcakes in Japan and around the globe is inexplicable. In fact, <i>Evangelion<i>'s pull as a cultural property--as stated earlier--is in my mind totally absurd. It'd be like if Don Hertzfeldt's <i>World of Tomorrow<i> series inspired pinball machines and a ride at Disneyland.

A fascinating cultural object indeed; psychosexual antics and an apocalypse scored to J-pop result in a multibillion dollar franchise--who could've guessed the world was so perplexing?

2020-12-15,Zodiac,2007,https://boxd.it/1vOtNj,5,Yes,"Fincher's skill as a director cannot be understated. In only 4 feature films (<i>Alien3, Seven, The Game, Fight Club</i>) he established himself as one of the most intelligent and capable filmmakers working in the studio system. Don't forget also that <i>Alien3</i>, one of the most expensive films in its day, was directed by him at age 29. 

I've heard arguments that Fincher is probably the greatest living director but that, because he insists on remaining in the $50 million plus studio system, his best work is kept at bay. This only became more true as Hollywood segued into the 2010s, where non-blockbuster films were all but prohibited by the studios (Fincher was slated to direct <i>World War Z 2<i></i> for a time this decade, if that's any indication of how limiting studio filmmaking must be).

But Fincher had a gift for arm-twisting I'm sure in the preceding decades because despite the constrictions he made two films that absolutely spat in the face of convention; <i>Fight Club</i>, an anti-corporate satire that remains one of the most bizarre films ever produced by a major studio, and what I and many others feel is his masterpiece, <i>Zodiac</i>.

Shrewd and cynical as I'm sure Fincher is, he's still an artist, and like most artists is great when he doesn't shy away from his interests. <i>Zodiac</i> is the purest distilling of the perfectionist director's idiosyncratic--also prurient--interests. It's a detective/manhunt movie, like <i>Se7en</i>, but also a procedural, a drama, and above all a meditation on obsession, possibly the most cinematic subject in existence (look no further than <i>Vertigo</i> or <i>There Will be Blood<i></i>).

<i>Zodiac</i> is so extraordinary, I think, because there's no film quite like it made on this scale. It's essentially a true-crime thriller, recreating in some cases excruciating details about the crimes depicted. Having read Robert Graysmith's novel on which the film was chiefly based, I'm remarkably impressed not only by how faithful the film is, but by how in some cases--such as in the Kathleen Johns story--it interrogates and sometimes builds on what detective work has already been done, as if it the film were not a dramatization but a reopening of the real-life case.

Despite a 2 1/2 hour runtime, <i>Zodiac</i> is one of the best paced movies I've seen, and by the end has engrossed its audience so completely that seeing the credits roll is like slowly waking from a fugue state.

<i>Zodiac<i></i> is also so unpretentious and detail-oriented that it only dawns on us later how inconspicuously poignant it is, and how perfectly it encapsulates that brief monologue by Dave Toschi:

Unfortunately, this continues to be true, with CG animation supplanting 2D animation when in fact the two are completely different mediums which ought to coexist.

<i>The Princess and the Frog</i> is the best animated film Disney has made this century. That it didn't make any money shocked and confused me at the time, and still does to this day.

I'm also perplexed by the continued ignorance of this film, evidenced especially by the recent praise for Disney's <i>Soul.</i> Did journalists simply forget that just 11 years earlier a big-bidget, Disney-animated film also starring an african-american cast was released?

Spielberg proceeds to show Navorski in close-up opening the russian book, reading one portion, then scrambling to the english for a direct translation.

2021-09-26,The Idiot,1951,https://boxd.it/2aa4BV,2.5,,"This is a frustrating movie. It contains some of Kurosawa's best filmmaking, but it's also terribly melodramatic, and its first half is so butchered as to be almost unwatchable.

Shame, because Kurosawa clearly loves the source novel so much, but the material simply doesn't translate to film. Too many long passages of characters seeming forlorn, reiterating the same points to each other in extended, often boring dialogue sequences.

But then there are scenes like the paranoid montage before the end of Act I, featuring a stellar shot where Mori crosses a bridge over a train depot, turning to spot Toshiro Mifune's menacing silhouette behind him in the distance before being enveloped in the billowing steam of a passing train below. Beautiful.

And Setsuko Hara acting like no one whose seen an Ozu film could possible imagine her, with a costume and makeup that seems to be channeling Maria Casares as Death in Cocteau's <i>Orphee</i>. It's sad that Hara only acted for Kurosawa twice, because in both films she has a ferocity and forbidding presence totally unlike anything I've seen from a female performer in a Kurosawa film.

Then there's Mifune, who in this gives one of his very best performances, culminating in a climax where he silently stands bug-eyed in his boxing robe and completely holds your attention while doing so.

There are so many great things in this movie, including a fanatical, kind of scary closing passage where Mifune and Mori quietly go insane together, but it's not enough to make the movie good. Kurosawa's original cut of the film is said to have run 4 and a half hours in length. I would've liked to see that version, but apparently its lost. Damn shame.

Without a doubt, this is Satoshi Kon's most obtuse movie, and that is quite a feat from the man who made <i>Perfect Blue</i>. Where do the movies and memories separate? No matter how many times I watch this, I cannot for the life of me decide.

This is maybe Kon's least seen and admired movie, but I think it might be his greatest achievement. There are sections in this movie which test my patience and pale in comparison to the breathless spectacle of <i>Paprika</i> or <i>Perfect Blue</i>, yet I've spent more time poring over it in my mind than I have those two other films combined.

Confused and frustrated as I am every time I watch this, I'm still moved in the end by Chiyoko's implacable persistence, and by the way Mr. Tachibana continues to be in her thrall even while her star fades and is forgotten. It's also a movie whose narrative design--filtering what might be a conventional actress' biopic through the refractive lens of the films she starred in--is so ingenious that it begs to be imitated.

But most of all, <i>Millennium Actress</i> is an ode to how movies shape who we are and how we perceive reality and memory. Is Chiyoko senile when she describes her life story such that it's indistinguishable from her films? Is everything in the film completely unreliable? I don't know, and that not knowing is very, very frustrating, but it's only frustrating because the movie's so mesmerizing. 

Like Kurosawa's <i>The Idiot</i>, this is another one of those frustrating films that if viewed through an empty beer bottle or something might look like a masterpiece. Or maybe I'm an idiot, and having beer bottles for eyes can't see a masterpiece when it's staring me in the face.","satoshi kon, japan, anime",2021-10-01

An amazingly poignant and bittersweet final film. The famous american-japanese film scholar Donald Richie said something really interesting which is that compared with Americans the Japanese were great at goodbyes. This explains the essence of great films like <i>The Wind Rises</i> and <i>An Autumn Afternoon</i>. Each film is a goodbye, and a pointed one at that.

Having watched now 24 of Kurosawa's 30 feature films, I think he just might be the greatest director who ever lived. Certainly he belongs on a list with Griffith, Murnau, and Hitchcock as one of the directors who shaped modern movies.","akira kurosawa, japan",2021-10-04

This is Anderson at peak ""Anderson-ness."" Every shot is composed within an inch of its life. So much information is packed into each frame that watching it on a 3-story cinema screen is overwhelming. The film is structured like a children's book, and looks like one too. Some scenes are animated like Tintin comic strips. The movie is in 4:3, b&w the entire way except at 2-second intervals when it isn't.

This also feels like Anderson trying something *really* different because the first two stories feel like very direct comments on the politics of the last 5 years (though the 1st story is more subtle), and the movie generally continues the trend since <i>Grand Budapest Hotel</i> of darkening the palette, and being more melancholy than funny.

Also, it is truly, *truly* amazing the ensemble cast Anderson is able to assemble with these movies. He must be the most well-liked director in hollywood because with every film and this one in particular he is able to assemble a prestige cast so staggeringly bloated that multiple oscar winners and nominees appear in what amount to cameos and walk-ons. He must be a charming man.

Anyway, I have no idea if this will get a wide release or make any money because its definitely one of Anderson's least accessible movies but I enjoyed it very much despite being more an admirer than a fan.","theatre, diff, alamo drafthouse",2021-10-08

I hadn't seen this since it came out I don't think and was curious if I'd like it any more now than I did. Not really, but I do see why it's becoming better received. As climate change occupies our thoughts more and more, <i>Interstellar</i> is like a comforting, idealistic prediction of mankind's best-case scenario, although I've always felt the ""happy ending"" was the weakest part.

Nolan is a master though. The discipline and subtlety in how he shoots the space sequences has clearly influenced subsequent films like <i>First Man</i> and <i>Ad Astra</i>, and the plot is (for the most part) so intelligently done and the storytelling so epic that it's impossible not to be swept up. 

It's also *really* unusual because it contains hard-hitting emotional beats completely absent from his other movies, which does make it stand out compared with masterpieces like <i>Inception</i> and <i>Dunkirk</i>, but in all honesty I think those two movies are Nolan's best precisely *because* they are so lean and are focused so much on logic (yes, I like <i>Inception</i> *because* of the exposition, not in spite of it!).

<i>Interstellar</i> is a landmark achievement, but I still think that unlike <i>Inception</i> it's <i>im</i>perfect.",christopher nolan,2021-11-01

But doesn't it seem like a sitcom compared to this? 

<i>Wall-E</i> is Pixar doing serious sci-fi and satire with basically zero pandering. It's first half hour is wordless. The main characters are robots who're anthropomorphized <i>a little</i> but not a lot, and its ending is hopeful but nothing revelatory. Earth is still decaying and dead for the most part.

How did this get made? It's so adventurous and experimental, but it was made for millions of dollars and with the support of squeaky-clean parent company Disney, who these days just seem interested in rebooting decrepit IPs. It seems like Pixar in the first decade or so was truly operating with the attitude of a start-up, with every film being a collaboration where the best ideas of everyone working on it shined through.

Watching <i>Wall-E</i> only 13 years later is such a revelation because it feels so unlike anything I can imagine getting made by Pixar or by any major studio today. It's beautiful and uncompromising and special. 

Pixar continues to make good movies, but not great movies. Every once in a while the old masters step in, like when Pete Doctor returned to make <i>Inside Out</i> and <i>Soul</i>, breathing some life back into the studio, but for the most part it seems like their creativity and innovation has become stifled under the weight of financial responsibility. Can't risk losing money for Disney shareholders in Q3 am I right? Can't pretend like that's unique to Pixar though, it happens to lots of companies.

<i>Wall-E</i> is a testament to that special period in Pixar's history when each film was both a technical and artistic milestone. It's truly a masterpiece and I miss when Pixar was this good.","masterpiece, pixar",2021-12-09
2021-12-12,Licorice Pizza,2021,https://boxd.it/2lXix1,4.5,,"Was lucky enough to see this in a packed theater in 70mm. A magical movie, but surprisingly I actually did lose patience near the end. Maybe on re-watch I'll be more accepting of the movie's episodic structure and extended runtime, but for now I think they actually could've lost 1 or 2 sequences and been better for it.

Also, as many have said, the movie just kind of ends. A reunion which should've been cathartic feels a bit anti-climactic. I think ending on, say, the Sean Penn episode might've been more powerful. As it stands, it feels like the movie kinda cycles through the same patterns of jealousy, separation and reunion for the last hour so that the very last scene doesn't land as much as it should. 

It may sound like I'm down on the movie, but that's only because it's so near goddamn-perfect. I honestly feel like if the movie had ended after Gary ran to comfort Alana when she fell off the motorcycle that this would've been a 5, though the Jon Peters scene would've had to be moved to before then, which I think was possible.

So, why did I see this movie? Because Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy was an integral part of my young childhood, and try as I might I can't silence the 8-year old inside still pining for a Spider-Man 4.

This isn't really Spider-Man 4, but in any case it does resurrect the previous iterations of Spider-Man in a kind of poignant way. The plot is contrived as hell (how stupid can Tom Holland spider-man be to NOT send home every villain instantly, I mean really?), and no matter how I try I can never get into the whole MCU thing, but my god I'd be lying if the fan-service in this--for the first time ever!--actually worked for me.

Surprisingly, Andrew Garfield spider-man's appearance was the highlight, even with his Jonathon Larson haircut. When the real spidey shows up (tobey ofc), he's literally just standing there in jeans and a tshirt. Did my heart not still skip a beat? You bet your ass it did.

Can't lie, <i>Spider-Man 2</i> was one of the first films I remember seeing in the theater. Raimi's first <i>Spider-Man</i> I remember renting from blockbuster. Even the maligned <i>Spider-Man 3</i> was beloved by 7-year old me. Not many movie series really have a place in my heart but that one does. Seeing Tobey and Willem and Molina appear alongside the current franchise iterations they inspired is definitely a treat.

Does that make this film really good? Not really. The MCU house style is still dull as dishwater, and the Tom Holland spider-man is.. ok i guess. But there is a poignancy here in seeing a decades-in-the-making franchise crossover like this, where the new generation pays respect to the old. Calculated as it is, this is probably the most successful nostalgia-trip since <i>The Force Awakens</i>.

It was very smart to allow the 3 spidey's so much casual screen time together, and I love how the movie ends by pressing the reset button and basically turning MCU spider-man into Sam Raimi spider-man. Altogether there is a love for the Sam Raimi movies in this which I did not expect and was pleased by; the special role Willem Dafoe's goblin plays in this is evidence of that.

I'm such a Raimi Spider-Man fanboy that I honestly waited through the entire credits hoping for a little scene where Maguire reunited with Kirsten Dunst's MJ. It was just some Doctor Strange bullshit and I was disappointed but whatever. I was also hoping for a bruce campbell cameo but I guess that just wansn't gonna happen. I'm not gonna see the future MCU spidey movies but I am glad I saw this one.","theatre, jon watts, marvel",2021-12-17

2022-01-21,The Making of Silent Hill 2,2001,https://boxd.it/2vlgUh,5,,"Ok I'm gonna cheat and use this making of (which I have seen and is good) as an opportunity to talk about <i>Silent Hill 2</i>.

Any kid who grew up with a PS2 knew about <i>Silent Hill</i>. I remember the trailers for the 2006 film, and seeing ads for the 4th game on a CRT in gamestop. Most of all, I remember Xplay on G4 (remember that channel!?) voting that <i>Silent Hill 2 </i>was the scariest game of all time.

I forewent <i>Silent Hill</i> for years somehow, always familiar with the foggy town aesthetic but too young at the time and too disinterested in gaming during my teens to try them out. Only now with the advent of numerous mods to the initially-crappy PC port have I experienced <i>Silent Hill 2.</i>

There's no other way to put this; <i>Silent Hill 2 </i>is a flat out masterpiece, and its great in a way video games seldom are. It contains the same expert balance between story and gameplay that a game like <i>Half-Life</i> or <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> does, but it adds on top of that a surprising poetry that is just so rare in games.

I'm generally pretty skeptical of pretentious games straining to be artistic. <i>Journey </i>is poetic but is at heart a walking simulator and is kinda boring, while <i>The Last of Us </i>contains an amazing story and characters but gameplay that is kinda generic third person shooter stuff. 
<i>
Silent Hill 2 </i>is a survival horror game whose greatest strength--atmosphere--is predicated entirely on gameplay. There *are* pre-rendered cutscenes in <i>SH2</i>, but they don't carry the burden of establishing the characters or atmosphere. It's the exploration of the environment and tense encounters with soulless, allegorical monsters in deliberately awkward combat which establishes the oppressive atmosphere. 

<i>Silent Hil 2</i> and <i>Shadow of the Colossus </i>could be a tie for my favotite video game of all time because they both are cathartic meditations on crushing loneliness. They use the average gamer's most common emotional dilemma against them. <i>SH2 </i>doesn't contain as unique a gameplay loop as <i>Shadow</i>, but its story's psychological complexity and the ingenious ways it tells that story (like having the note from Mary which sits in your imventory slowly fade over time to signal its unrealness; brilliant!) more than compensates.

The video game industry has not quite woken up yet to the fact that games are an art form. It's unfortunately assumed that the older a game is the less valuable it is, kinda like how an old cell phone or OS becomes obsolete after only a few years from release. 

<b>This could not be further from the truth</b>.

<i>Silent Hill 2 </i>is more than 20 years old. Even with numerous graphics mods and widescreen fixes it is still clearly a game from a different era, with occasional low poly textures, awkward voice acting, and dated tank controls. This does not make it any less of a masterpiece or any less playable than the recent Call of Duty. In fact, 2022 Call of Duty is probably less worth its $60 price tag than 2001's <i>Silent Hill 2 </i>is.

Why? Because <i>Silent Hill 2</i> is not like an old version of Windows you uninstall and update after its usefulness has expired. You cannot simply trade in <i>Silent Hill 2</i>, or any video game for that matter, for a shiny new 2022 model which does all the same stuff as the original but ""better"". There is something in that original which is special and one-of-a-kind. That's what makes it Art. Poetry is lost in the translation, or in this case the remastering.

Anyone curious about the artistic potential of games has to play these three titles. All three are ingenious in how they use the interactive medium to create an emotional experience which is still fun in a traditional ""gamey"" way. 

In my favorite of them, <i>Ico</i>, the player has to hold R1 on the Playstation controller to hold hands with an NPC for almost the entire game. What in a modern game would be a quick-time event button prompt is a organic and integral part of the gameplay. 

Yes, *holding hands* is an integral part of the game. If you're curious how this is truly implemented, play the game yourself. It creates a game-like challenge while also building a relationship with this fictional character. It's genius and was unprecedented in 2001 when the game released.

2022-02-24,8 Mile,2002,https://boxd.it/2BGjkd,4,Yes,"Watching this 20 years later makes me feel old in a way I've never felt before. Might sound crazy but me and my sister listened to Eminem when we were in elementary school, mostly The Eminem Show (clean ofc). Even without the curse words and not understanding the explicit subtext of his lyrics we were mesmerized by his diction and rhythm. This was more than 15 years ago--long before Relapse--when Eminem was still king and could do no wrong.

<i>8 Mile</i> is basically <i>The Karate Kid</i> with rap battles instead of martial arts. It's not original, and it could've been something much more had a more daring screenwriter and producer taken on the project, but as it stands this is still one of the best underdog movies, and Eminem is solid gold in his screen debut even if his performance is somewhat in the editing (that's courtesy of Curtis Hanson, an underappreciated director who really is what makes this movie work).

I think some kids and young adults slightly younger than me who don't know Eminem and <i>8 Mile</i> might not realize that their generation of jimmy fallon freestyle segments and Epic Rap Battles of History owes such a debt to this movie. Of course it existed before, but it wasn't brought to a mainstream (mostly white) audience until this movie. In fact I get the feeling <i>8 Mile</i>'s pretty overlooked nowadays, but it was HUGE when it came out. Lose Yourself was playing on the radio constantly and continued to be for years after.

This is all to say that Eminem is just one of those artists who will always make me nostalgic. There's lots of disdainful remarks about Gen-Zers, which I supposedly am (one of the oldest since I was born in 2000), but young people my age have had a tough time growing up amidst this surge of technological breakthroughs. In the time between my starting kindergarten and graduating high school, smart phones went from being nonexistent to unassailable, social media went from being trivial MySpace fluff to being twitter, facebook, snapchat, everything. The difference in consumer tech from 2002 to 2022 is much greater than from 1982 to 2002 (moore's law). I don't think the older generation appreciates how stressful these constant changes made growing up.

You'd think reading this it were a review for <i>Boyhood</i>, but Eminem and this movie are enough to make me reminisce about the early 00's. In a way, that decade me and my sister grew up in was the last gasp of the 20th century, before mobile computing and social media took over. Funny how growing up the PTSA at my school tried to ban the newfangled ipods from school, seeing it as the kind of menace smart phones pose now, yet I remember so fondly listening to Eminem's tinny raps on the old ipod nano with my sister. 

I thought that was high tech back then. Of course I didn't get an ipod for my birthday, I got a CD player, so I had to listen to my Linkin Park CD at night with the stereo turned way down in my bedroom. That was my childhood. Linkin Park CDs and Eminem on ipod nano. Wait a second, do kids in middle school today know what an ipod is?",curtis hanson,2022-02-23
2022-03-02,West Side Story,2021,https://boxd.it/2CIirZ,4,,"The reason until now another film adaptation of West Side Story has been unthinkable is because Robert Wise's 1961 original still holds up amazingly well, even with the outdated casting.

I still think there's really no reason for <i>Spielberg's West Side Story</i> to exist (especially now that it's flopped at the box office), but even so Spielberg's virtuosity and craft is just of such a staggering caliber that he almost justifies it. It also helps that the big flaw of the original, the casting, has been corrected.

That said, this version really does so little to change-up the style or tone of the original that it really feels more like a refinement than a reimagining, and also feels pretty out of place in the 2020s.

Not gonna lie, when I first saw this at the Alamo Drafthouse Ritz in Austin (sadly closed) I did hate it. Seeing it again  after watching the similar but more mainstream <i>The Batman</i>,  I have a renewed appreciation for it. It stills feels made 50% from direct homages to <i>Taxi Driver</i>, <i>The King of Comedy</i>, and <i>Network</i>, but the other 50% is totally original Joaquin Phoenix craziness (the fridge scene! the talk show climax!)

Even with the contrived treatment of mental illness (Arthur is crazy enough to think he can do stand-up but clever enough to dress in a disguise at the movie theater?) and the on-the-nose 'we live in a society' of it all, there is still something undeniably commendable about the balls it took to make this movie. Even more so than in 2019, this feels so unsafe and insane for a movie adapted from such a well-known IP.

I remember when Todd Philips was on the THR roundtable of directors nominated for the Oscar that year. Greta Gerwig and Martin Scorsese were yucking it up, then the moderator turned to Todd and it's like everyone else at the table went quiet, regarding him with a combination of what I surmise was fear and resentment. Resentment because Todd was a 'low' comedy director who'd suddenly made a seat with the big boys, and fear because despite the fact his movie was mean-spirited and disturbing it had made more money than all of their films combined.

That kind of hush-hush discomfort that this movie inspires makes it, whether you like it or not, a kind of once-in-a-generation piece of art that truly captures the zeitgeist in a way that the technically superior but far less interesting <i>The Batman</i> does not.",todd phillips,2022-03-07

- and I thought <i>Swiss Army Man</i> was weird!
- I did not think the Turn Down for What music video directors would change cinema but I think they just did
- the insanely literal Wong Kar Wai homage blew my mind more than <i>The Shining</i> in <i>Ready Player One</i> did
- In fact I wanna re-watch <i>In the Mood For Love</i> right now because holy shit that's a great movie and it looks like a juicy steak compared to this movies sour patch kids
- james hong is movie royalty. does no one realize he was like 40 in Chinatown?
- michelle yeoh is also royalty
- for anyone who loves chinese or hong kong cinema this movie is such a massive, succulent treat
- OMG THAT WAS SHORT ROUND HE'S SO GOOD IN THIS MOVIE
- this movie kinda takes place entirely in an IRS building which is kind of hilarious

Also of note, I saw this at a private screening but the RSVP auto-replies broke, so the organizers wound up with a list of people who didn't know they were invited, meaning the screening was almost empty (like 15 people). That made me sad--I legit might've liked the movie more if the screening were full like it should've been.

Anyway, this movie's great and its probably gonna change cinema but I think all of its imitators are probably gonna suck. Also, I can't really rate it because I'm not sure what to think just yet. I've gotta sit on it.","theatre, daniels, 2022",2022-04-06

The vibes of these 60s b&w japanese films are so intoxicating though. There's never any day-for-night shots in these movies; the night scenes are true night, with inky black skies.

But you know what? if there was a 2nd season, I would watch it right now. In the midst of so much extended universe malarkey which takes itself way too seriously, here's a series which feels so self-contained and quaint that its hard to believe it wasn't made in 2003 (for real though, that Ep. 2 rooftop chase was straight out of Ben Affleck's <i>Daredevil</i>).

There's a light touch here that's appreciated despite the serious subtext about Marc Specter's broken psyche, made explicit in the amazing Ep. 5. For the most part this is infectiously silly, old-fashioned superhero stuff, but elevated to another level by Oscar Isaac's virtuoso performance(s?).

It's just so refreshing to see a superhero series without ANY, and I mean literally ZERO allusions to an extended universe, and with an emphasis on small-scale character development rather than overblown production values and CGI battles. 

It really is uncanny just how much this feels like it was made in 2004; the badly rendered CGI Moon Knight leaping over rooftops, the being self-contained, the sloppiness, Ethan Hawke, the straight-up <i>National Treasure</i> homage that is Ep. 4! There's even a line at the end where Ammit says ""Why do you continue to fight?"" and Khonshu replies ""because I *choose* too."" Seriously, that's taken straight from <i>The Matrix Revolutions</i>. Oh how I miss the early 2000s!

When I was a kid and I thought of a Marvel superhero movie, this is what I thought of. Something that was sloppy, but zippy and fun. I got that same feeling watching this as I did seeing the third X-Men movie, or the 2005 Fantastic Four. Corny, imperfect, but really light and charming. Even with so much weirdness and that totally rushed, dissatisfying finale, I still kind of loved this.","tv, marvel",2022-05-04

This is far and away the best-directed and most purely entertaining Marvel film I've seen since the first <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>. There are the obvious star-power cameos thrown in but the movie doesn't lean into that for its biggest pleasures. This feels 80% of the time like an out-&-out Raimi horror flick. It doesn't take itself seriously at all. There is a literal music battle. I mean, wow.

I have a theory about where the MCU is going now that its the biggest thing in the world. Clearly there was a peak with <i>Endgame</i>, now where is there to go? Open the doors to real filmmakers! This and <i>Eternals</i> are Marvel films unimaginable around the time of, say, <i>Age of Ultron</i>. The <i>Moon Knight</i> series on Disney+ was similarly bonkers and risky.

2022-05-12,Sleepy Hollow,1999,https://boxd.it/2PJ61T,3,,"Tim Burton is and has always been a strange case. <i>Sleepy Hollow</i> is one of the best looking and feeling movies I've ever seen. The production design and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is just amazing. Even watching it on the outdated blu-ray (this could really use an HDR re-release!) the film hardly looks almost 25 years old.

But the storytelling is just weak. Even though the film's supposed to be a mystery, I felt no suspense or intrigue. The screenplay features several red herrings and dramatic revelations, but something about the pace of the film, the acting, the general storytelling, just doesn't convey any of the intended emotions.

This has always been my problem with Tim Burton's movies. I honestly think that, in many ways, he is simply a bad storyteller. Even though this movie's loaded with things I love, such as the gothic atmosphere, macabre humor, and goofy performances by great actors, there's just no dramatic heft to any of the proceedings. Every scene meant to further the plot feels totally perfunctory. The moments that really come alive are when nothing much is happening, interestingly enough.

Burton is a director I'm definitely nostalgic about. I have fond memories of <i>Beetlejuice</i>, <i>Edward Scissorhands</i>, even <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>. But looking at his films as an adult, there's something that doesn't click. He's a very hit and miss director, and even though on paper I should love <i>Sleepy Hollow</i> more than, say, <i>Big Fish</i>, the sloppy storytelling and lousy ending just botches the movie.

I enjoyed the film a lot as a dark comedy in the opening scenes, but then as it went on I got the sinking feeling this was all meant as some sort of allegory about white colonialism, or something, which makes me like the movie less. Not that that isn't an interesting topic, but why be so obscure about it?

There's also a typical of the 90s ""subversive"" depiction of a christian missionary as a maniacal zealot, an angle which by now is totally played out and kinda gets on my nerves actually. All in all, Jim Jarmusch isn't the director for me.",jim jarmusch,2022-05-17

<i>Top Gun: Maverick</i> is great entertainment, and I'm glad it's doing so well at the box office, but it is sort of depressing that this kind of movie is considered a quaint novelty nowadays, where 30 years ago it would've seemed as average as <i>Cliffhanger</i> starring Sylvester Stallone.

I've seen this maybe a dozen times, but every rewatch I see something new. A new detail in the screenplay (""you would do that for me?""), and develop a new appreciation for just how tightly constructed and perfectly edited it is. Aaron Sorkin is of course a fantastic screenwriter, but it really is Fincher's direction that makes this a masterpiece.

This is just one of those cases of a perfect script, director, and cast of actors coming together at the right time to create something which was of the moment and yet timeless. This is one of my favorite movies, but I'm also tempted to say its just objectively one of the best films--if not THE best film--to come out this century, and no matter how many times I've seen it, that last shot with the text ""Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire"" as he sits slumped in his chair about to cry always give me chills.

The biggest one is that the animation component just doesn't work. This probably should've been made with more input from an experienced animation director because at so many moments the two main characters almost seem too realistically animated, coming across as borderline expressionless.

Kind of a shame because the screenplay and some of the gags are pretty good, but there are flaws in the design of this movie that make it kind of boring ultimately. I really think Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg, and Jorma Taccone should get another chance at a big studio comedy like <i>Popstar</i> since that's really what they were born to do.

At the time the night photography in this was considered groundbreaking, and even though it looks a bit amateur by todays standards this still is one of the best uses of digital cinematography I've ever seen. I know there are film purists out there but this movie would not have been better had it been done on film with heaps of artificial light thrown at the actors to compensate for the lack of light in real-life nighttime Los Angeles.

This is Tom Cruise's best role; better than <i>Magnolia</i>, <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, <i>Interview with a Vampire</i>, etc. It's amazing how well Cruise pulls off playing this truly evil but complex character--so well that it's actually kind of disturbing.

There are so many positives in this movie it's amazing I only am rating it 4 stars. There are many 5-star elements in this movie but for some reason it doesn't come together. The premise is brilliant, there are moments of quiet and real intelligence in the dialogue. Mann is an uber-confident director. But there are problems; the third act devolves into a pretty typical action climax that defies believability and compromises the intelligence of Cruise's character. Jamie Foxx's character evolves a little too quickly which strains believability.

There's also a kind of blacklist quality to the screenplay for some reason that I found a bit distracting; some philosophical dialogue passages might even go too long. This movie is so good in so many ways but it feels compromised somehow. <i>Heat</i> was uncompromised. There was some poetry but it was very stripped down and brutally real in many ways. <i>Collateral</i> becomes a little *hollywood* at the end. I could watch this again and change my mind, since this <i>almost</i> feels like one of my favorite movies, but it doesn't stick the landing.

Michael Mann is a great director for many reasons, one of them being that he directs shockingly modern films despite being old enough to live in a nursing home. Fan favorite directors like Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, they're constantly mining the past, making period piece after period piece, crowding their movies with music from 40 or 50 years ago. I have so much respect for artists who no matter what try to stay relevant and make something modern.

Michael Mann was 60 years old when he directed this! 60 years and he's doing something so new and experimental with the digital cinematography, and setting this in the modern 2004 with cell phones and EDM.

During the middle stretch I was sure I'd love this movie, but the 3rd act just kinda fizzles into nothing. I see what the director was going for thematically, but in the Jordan Peele era of metaphorically complex, artful horror cinema, this seemed a bit on-the-nose.

2022-09-17,Manhunter,1986,https://boxd.it/3esrm5,5,,"<i>Silence of the Lambs</i> might be a better movie in many ways. It has Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, a unique protagonist in a crime movie. It has muscular filmmaking that tells the audience at every juncture what their thoughts and feelings should be. 

<i>Manhunter</i> is comparatively sloppy; it's a bit slow, and some of the acting can feel forced. But I don't love <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>, though I admire it. I do love <i>Manhunter</i> though.

Why? Because whereas <i>Silence</i> is about getting under the skin of Clarice Starling, and identifying 100% with her perspective, <i>Manhunter</i> is about getting under the skin of the killer, which is much more disturbing and--for me at least--more interesting, and more germane to a film dealing with serial killers.

The slow, methodical manhunt movie genre is a personal favorite of mine. <i>Zodiac</i> is probably the best detective/manhunt movie ever made, but this has many of the same pleasures. The slow, realistic depiction of a criminal investigation, the forensics and the psychology, and the teamwork. That's all stuff I love to see.

I also love how unglamorous this movie is. There is no overblown, absurd scene where Hannibal Lecter is flown in, flanked by SWAT and police, to have the portentous confrontation with the senator. There are no big, dramatic acting scenes where characters chew on meaty dialogue like they're performing Shakespeare. Every scene is set in a dank office, dark room, or rambler house. Our protagonist spends most of his time alone, rambling to himself, so that he seems almost as crazy as the killer.

The killer himself is neither charming, out-of-control, nor particularly intelligent. He is, more disturbingly, incredibly normal looking, which by all accounts is very accurate to real life. He's also incredibly sad, and Tom Noonan as the wimpy, pathetic killer is what makes this movie special. 

His performance might be the best I've ever seen depicting a serial killer because he is just so normal. The scenes he shares with Joan Allen are just incredible. This man who has butchered parents and children sees this lonely blind woman, takes pity, and brings her to a vet so she can stroke a Bengal tiger and experience what must be a heavenly sensation for someone so attuned to touch. That his relationship with her feels so authentic and real and psychologically believable is all the more astounding, as this very easily could've felt trite or sentimental, but it does not.

Then there's that moment when Noonan pulls up to Allen's house, and he sees her with another man. His madonna/whore complex is very real. He imagines her embracing this man, and in his fantasy there is that fantastic bright light that shines through her front door as she kisses him. This scene is so poetic, and moving, and disturbing and sad all at the same time. It's just one of those moments you get in a great film that sets my heart on fire, and reminds me why I love movies.

I mean, really, so many positives. The idea of pairing the old and young characters in this situation, the anti-establishment underpinnings, the genius way that the zombie epidemic spreads. It's all perfect.

There's only one problem with this movie; Dan O' Bannon is a writer, he is not a director. The directing is serviceable, but there are obvious flaws in the editing and the staging. The setup is a bit of a slog, and the acting is inconsistent.

This is truly a fascinating movie that should be studied in film schools. If this screenplay had been given a bigger budget and a more experienced director it could've been not just a horror masterpiece, but a *masterpiece* masterpiece.

2022-10-20,The Hunger,1983,https://boxd.it/3liM6l,3,,"My brain wasn't prepared for this movie. Lesbian vampire love scenes? David Bowie being on the poster then killed after 20 minutes? Willem DaFoe's FACE appears for some reason. The Schubert piano trio being used EXACTLY the same as in <i>Barry Lyndon</i> and also WAY TOO MUCH. Monkey homicide. The list goes on.

There's no way I can call this a good movie, but I kinda love it. The story is just that Queen of the Nile Twilight Zone episode stretched feature length and told incomprehensibly with all these weird arthouse tricks. Associative editing, minutes-long montages set only to music, slow-motion.

2022-12-16,Lenny,1974,https://boxd.it/3xf2eb,5,,"I've seen <i>Lenny</i> many times, it's one of my favorite movies.

There are some clips of this movie <i>Lenny</i> on YouTube that I pulled up this morning just because it crossed my mind, and I noticed something really funny... Several clips of the movie, all of which are recreations of real-life Lenny Bruce stand-up comedy routines, were... muted. That's right. YouTube moderators removed the audio from the clips, which I presume is because the clips were flagged for obscenities or hate speech.

I just have to point this out. <i>Lenny</i>, a film made in 1974, was meant to point out how far the culture had come from the censorship of the early 1960s, and that Lenny Bruce's provocative but insightful comedy was unfairly silenced. Now, in 2022, the most popular video-sharing website in the world is censoring him in a similar way all these years later. 

This just blows my mind on so many levels. It's honestly insulting to Lenny Bruce's legacy to remove that content. Whether you find his comedy distasteful or not, it should not be censored. This once-mainstream movie about outdated censorship being censored years later is just such a beautiful bellwether for the times we live in it's actually insane.","bob fosse, masterpiece",

2022-12-21,Avatar: The Way of Water,2022,https://boxd.it/3yKaM7,4,Yes,"Let's face it. The 2020s have been a terrible decade for movies so far. Experimental, well-liked films such as <i>Everything Everywhere</i> or <i>Bardo</i> have pleased a niche audience of film nerds on streaming, but movies as a cultural phenomenon have been totally eclipsed by music, video games, and TV in the same way theatrical movies once eclipsed the novel.

I think most people my age or younger can't even remember how much a phenomenon a movie like <i>The Dark Knight</i> was when it came out. I certainly do. It was a movie that literally ruled the summer and was on the tip of everyone's tongue. People didn't just show up for opening weekend either as they do with a typical marvel blockbuster, they came back again and again because ticket prices were actually affordable, the movie itself was great, and because the theater on its own was a community space where kids were welcome to hang out, play at the arcade, and chat with friends.

All of that is a distant memory. 10 years from now, movie theaters might not even exist, and people's idea of a communal movie-going experience could be a VR screening of <i>Inception</i> inside Fortnite. I honestly don't even know.

If you really love movies--and I mean, *actually* love movies--please go see something at the theatre. Stop pirating everything. Stop sitting on your ass at home watching movies with an audience of one. Support the troops. I don't know what else to say.

For many, <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i> was THE movie this year that brought back the theatrical experience. It wasn't for me. No, <i>Avatar: The Way of Water</i> is that movie.

James Cameron is an old man but holy shit is he trying to entertain you. This movie's 3 hours, and not a single minute is anything but visually stunning and admirably earnest. There is tin-eared dialogue, unspectacular child acting, and save-the-whales schmaltz. You know what. Fuck you. Remember <i>Free Willy</i>? That's a movie people actually saw and liked. Not every movie has to be coy and postmodern. This is good old-fashioned, meat-and-potatoes epic storytelling done with technical expertise far surpassing anything that's been done the last decade.

Watching <i>Avatar TWOW</i>, you realize how numb we've become collectively to special effects. The Marvel films contain shot after shot of VFX but very rarely do the visuals actually pop. A film like <i>Top Gun</i> skirts this problem by doing things for real, but <i>Avatar<i> somehow impresses me even more because it's beating Marvel at it's own game.

I mean, goddamn, I literally said ""wow"" out loud like Owen fucking Wilson as I watched this because it is so immaculately done. Anyone who isn't wowed by this I kind of pity because I'm not sure how much more a movie can do to inspire this much awe. Yes, the story is storybook simple and the characters are archetypes, but that's a very deliberate choice by Cameron because it allows the spectacle to rise above everything, and for me that's honestly what a Movie movie is all about.

James Cameron KNOWS how to take my money, and you know what--here it is, take it--'cause I want more.</i></i>","james cameron, dolby 3d, theatre, 2022, high frame rate",2022-12-20

This is the movie that <i>It Follows</i>, <i>Oculus</i>, <i>Hereditary</i>, and the entire indie horror boom of the 2010s was leading to. This watered-down jump-scare generator that borrows A24 aesthetics to distract from how gimmicky and shallow it's <i>The Ring</i> style premise is.

Of course this is competently directed, acted, and has a few good jumpscares, but the PTSD subtext feels toothless, and the spooky atmosphere never sinks in like intended. I honestly wanted to give this a chance, but despite the hype I found it real dull.","parker finn, 2022",2022-12-22

2022-12-24,"BARDO, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths",2022,https://boxd.it/3zzhxb,4,,"After 3 years since the pandemic of nothing interesting there's suddenly an avalanche of fascinating, unusual movies from major auteur directors coming out these last months. While I've not loved all of them, it feels like such a relief after 3 boring years of bland <i>Coda</i>s and <i>Nomadland</i>s filling the movie-buff conversation.

As for <i>Bardo</i>, here's the thing. If I were a film critic, I guess I'd have to be critical of this movie, and adore something like <i>Tar</i>, which is much more controlled and organized. But I'm not a critic. <i>Tar</i> is interesting but ultimately boring. <i>Bardo</i> is sloppy and kind of meaningless but fuck it's entertaining!

The breathtaking recreation of the migrant convoy from Honduras, the post-apocalyptic falling-down scene whose meaning I'm at a loss to, the playful TV studio scene. I don't care that, according to critics, Inarritu hasn't ""earned"" the right to make this movie or whatever. I don't believe in this kind of elitist gatekeeping--it's the same kind of thinking that prevents a genre director like Sam Raimi from receiving the mainstream acclaim he and others like him so clearly deserve.

So Inarritu has made movies in Hollywood. So what? He's a film director, not an activist. That doesn't mean he can't make something like this which is deeply personal.

My only demand from a film is that it's entertaining. <i>Bardo</i> is confusing, maddening, sometimes pompous, but one thing it never is--is boring.","2022, alejandro inarritu",2022-12-23

2022-12-28,Babylon,2022,https://boxd.it/3B3kSl,5,,"There's all these movies this year ""celebrating"" movies. <i>The Fabelmans</i>, <i>Empire of Light</i>, <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Bardo</i> to a certain extent. But you wanna know the truth? Most people under 25 don't give a shit about movies. You know what a movie is to most people my age? A Netflix original they watch on their phones for 10 minutes before taking their exam.

The ""magic"" of the movies is just... so dead. These ""celebration' movies, coming mostly from 50+ year old directors, are so out of touch with modern pop culture that it screams of desperation.

This decade has wrought so much destruction on our basic ways of life and like a breakup about to happen I've honestly wondered to myself again and again--why do I love movies? Maybe if I really dig it goes back to those midnight screenings at the Egyptian Theater in Capitol Hill, Seattle. Back in '05, '06 they would screen <i>Back to the Future</i> almost monthly for a sold out crowd of mostly college kids. Wow were those screenings incredible. My dad took me maybe a dozen times back then and you could feel the energy in the crowd and the love for what was on the screen.

In the almost 20 years since then, I've felt that energy slowly disappear from the multiplexes. I didn't just have to go to midnight screenings--a Saturday night at AMC of <i>Transformers</i> or <i>Hoot</i> would still garner a strong reaction and a good crowd. Then Blockbusters started to close, and Netflix became more than a DVD-by-mail service, and the Egyptian canceled their midnight screenings after being sold by Landmark Theatres. Right around the time I started high school was when I could see things starting to fall apart. Now here we are. The End. 

There are more movie theaters now than ever in the US, and there are less moviegoers than ever. I used to see more movies in the theatre in three months than I did in this entire year. Almost every time since Covid I've been to the multiplex it has been staggeringly empty. I cannot remember the last time I saw a sold out movie, maybe <i>Parasite</i>. Theaters show 10 bajillion ads before the movie and 25 minutes of trailers just so they can pay the rent. If you love movies it is so, so, so, so sad.

You know what else I've realized? Most people my age and especially younger don't even know what it's like to see movie magic. Those <i>Back to the Future</i> screenings... I was lucky to have experienced those at my age. Most young people right now think of movie theatres as lifeless and empty, like they've been the last 5 years.

This is all to say that I firmly believe at least for the time being that movies are dead. My love affair with movies that has lasted my entire life--it's over. I started listening to a lot of music this year. That's because I need something else to fill the void. Like it or not, my generation cares so little about movies that I have no choice but to give up on them. Half the theaters open right now, if not more, will be gone in 5 years. Mark my words, there's no miracle on the horizon. Movies are a relic.

Right, so <i>Babylon</i>. This is my favorite movie of the decade so far. This is what movie's should be but aren't, and I think Damien Chazelle has made this movie the way he has because he knows this is the last time he'll be able to get something like it released by a major studio into thousands of theaters. To call this another <i>Heaven's Gate</i> is too perfect. It's almost like Chazelle WANTED to make <i>Heaven's Gate</i>.

This movie captures the sadness, the bitter-sweetness of a time gone by. It's exactly what I needed at the end of this year that I've spent every unbusy minute of thinking nostalgically about the past. I'm truly amazed that Paramount let this release in it's current state. It ends with a documentary clip show of cinema continuing from the silent era up to the present, with protagonist Manny crying all through it, as if this movie itself were a lament. I've never seen Brad Pitt more genuinely pained in a movie than this. His character is told that he's past his prime at the end, and when he shoots himself you can feel cinema itself dying with him.

This isn't a perfect movie--it feels maybe too indebted to <i>Boogie Nights</i>, and is a little predictable. But you know what's amazing? Even though I knew the entire time how that Tobey Maguire scene was going to end, I still clenched my jaw during it because I was all wrapped up in the story, which is HOW IT SHOULD BE! Even the best movies of this decade so far have lacked that fundamental thrill that I expect from a great movie. 

<i>Everything Everywhere</i> is a perfect example of a meme-able, perfect for gen-z movie that is very creative and entertaining but is NOT what I love about movies. I honestly felt like an alien watching that one. It's like this generation looks for something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT in a movie than what I'm looking for. I want to be transported in a movie, and be wrapped up in the story without lots of postmodern winks and nudges. <i>Babylon</i> is EXACTLY that movie, and it getting that awful Cinemascore and awful opening weekend gross... things don't look too good.

Here's my new year's resolution: no more book-length Letterboxd reviews, and don't get my hopes up for new movies anymore. Cinema is dead. I've wasted my life investing in movies. I'm done.","damien chazelle, 2022, theatre",2022-12-27
